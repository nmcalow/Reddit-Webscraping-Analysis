I (23m) have had very little experience with alcohol. Never been to a bar, never been to a party with alcohol, never been drunk. I had a half-mouthful of wine once and that's it.

I'm interested in this girl and she wants to come to my apartment and have some wine, and I have reason to believe she wants something else to happen, too. Obviously, I have no intention of raping her, being deceitful, or trying to make her do something she'll regret. But I seriously don't understand how this works morally or legally and ultimately I don't want to do something wrong or hurt her because I don't know about alcohol.

&gt;Dukkha (/ˈduːkə/; Pāli; Sanskrit: duḥkha) is an important Buddhist concept, commonly translated as ""suffering"", ""pain"", ""unsatisfactoriness"" or ""stress"".[1][2][3][4] It refers to the fundamental unsatisfactoriness and painfulness of mundane life.

StellaLuna18,caodx2,"So I (17f) have been working at my first job for the last 5 months and often come home feeling distraught after dealing with crappy customers. 

I genuinely love this job as I have a great team/leadership and generally enjoy customer as they are usually lovely and a joy to serve, but with every shift comes a few bad apples. I only work weekends, but I feel that's when the entitled and arrogant people are at their worse. I'm generally a very confident person and customers often tell me I'm a delight to be served by as I'm very lively and helpful. However, I feel whenever i get a bad customer, it hurts me personally and they leave me in a grumpy/irritable mood, hating the world and resenting others. I have no issue confronting people as I'm not easily intimidated, and between the crackhead's and the arrogant/entitled people they hasn't been a lot in the last 5 months that I haven't been able to deal with. However, I'm always left pissed off and wanting to isolate myself from the world needing to recharge my social battery/bullshit tolerance. 

People are genuinely stupid and after a weekend of dealing with dumb and difficult people, followed by a week of public transport, Ive turn into this spiteful bitch that I, and most likely others don't enjoy being around. My patient is starting to wear thin and I'm worried if I don't figure out how to deal with this after effect from every shift I'm gonna start hating myself, the world and all the people in it. My faith in humanity is dwindling and I'd hate to loose my generally positive attitude in my normal life just because some entitled cow couldn't be a decent person just because I asked them to leave when we closed.

I have had many friends so to speak, but a pattern is emerging now where I'm just beginning to feel that the ""friendships"" that I have made have just been because of the situation that me and those people were in at the same time and that we were kind of ""forced"" to interact with one another (high school, college, different workplaces, etc.), because as soon as I've parted with these different places, the people who I considered as ""friends"" have just drifted away, whether it be my doing or their doing, or whether it's just the way it goes in life and it's nobodies doing. I don't know, I'm just so confused and I do feel lonely sometimes, I feel like there is something wrong with me or like I'm not good enough to have true, long lasting friendships with people.

I'm 25 years of age and I'm happily married, and to be honest I feel like my wife is the only single person in this world who I can be with in complete comfort. But even with my wife, I struggle to keep thinking of topics to talk about and things to say. I don't get the crippling awkwardness with my wife though, it's just with other people and I don't know if this is a big part of why I keep letting friendships go. It makes me avoid going out to do things sometimes, just the thought of how awkward it is going be when I run out of things to say makes me want to not bother and stay in solitude. But in doing that, it's just making me feel more lonely and it's just a vicious circle.

I've tried to rekindle some friendships of my past though, and near enough failed with every single one of them. I've invited old friends to come and play pool, come have a drink, a meal, but the response is usually very unenthusiastic and uninterested and it saddens me to think that I have these feelings about old friends when the sentiment doesn't feel reciprocated. I've even sent friend requests to some on Facebook and I've been ignored. I feel like they just don't like me and they think I'm annoying, I dont know. 

I feel like I've been pushed out of certain friendship groups before as well in the past and I kind of have my guard up to getting too emotionally invested in friends/groups of people just incase they want to isolate me again.

I see people who have kept long lasting friendships, even going as far back to High School and it makes me sad sometimes thinking why can't I sustain any form of friendship, and it makes me sad looking at old friends knowing that we had good times together just for it all to fade away again and again.

I made sure the coast was clear and settled in to the (handicap) stall at the end of the row, since it’s the most comfy of the 6 stalls and has its own sink. I’m sitting there for maybe 30 seconds, get done tinkling and just waiting for my BM to happen when someone walks in to also use the restroom. I briefly think to myself it will be ok, they can pee then be on their merry way, and I’ll only be here an extra minute or so, when all of a sudden I see a shadow next to me!! This person had gotten into the stall right next to me when there were 4 other, perfectly useable stalls that were NOT next to me!

Pissed off wipe and flush bc I’m not about to shat with someone 10 inches away from me. I go to wash my hands and have the bright idea to take my sweet ass time just in case this person needs to take a shit, they will also be surely inconvenienced as I was. Oh I milked every second so I could hurt this persons ego and bowels so much! I decided I should even wait so long that I leave the stall when they do! 

Brilliant! This plan was perfect. Passive aggressive confrontation at its best. Only, when I turned around in the stall to get a paper towel, I looked down at the stall next to me. DAMMMMIIITTTTT!!! 

It’s my office cube neighbors shoes. Whyyyy????!??!

I can’t confront her. Ugh now I’m stuck forever knowing that she’s one of THOSE people. *sobs internally* Shes my only friend at work and now she’s gone and ruined it all.

OniiLink,caq35y,"In my own experience the most toxic myths that I've encountered are:

* Having been sexually abused (specifically by a male abuser) turns the victim into a homosexual.

* Having been sexually abused as a child means that you will become a child abuser yourself, since most (if not all) child abusers have been abused.

* You deserved what happened to you.

The worst thing about these ideas though, is when you start to believe them as truth. As I am a victim of sexual abuse during early childhood, the actual abuse wasnt that hard to get over for me, what really did a number on me was how foster parents and other people treated me and expressed these ideas about me. I got to the point where I decided to kill myself because I didn't want to hurt anyone else, I deserved to die before I did something I hadn't done yet. Fortunately I was able to talk with people who could help me, but there are way too many people living in silence who may not have access to help.",NoStupidQuestions,What are some toxic myths surrounding childhood sexual abuse?

WhateverWeKnowWeknow,capw9y,So I was on Twitter and saw multiple posts of women taking photos of themselves with their boobs out in a grocery store. I’m all for the free nips movement but when the photo was posted to Twitter she covered up the nipples. If someone is trying to make nipples less sexualized shouldn’t they keep the nipples in and uncovered? If someone covers something up or blurs something out it is usually to protect information or censor out graphic content. So why if you are trying to push for free the nips would you cover up your nipples? I’m confused as to if people are truly passionate about the free nips movement or if they are just doing it for exposure.,NoStupidQuestions,New Trend for clout or progress?
Moltenmelt1,capvru,Ok so I’ve been doing it this way for around five years. I start by shitting and wiping normally. I then stick tp  slightly up my ass with my finger  for a little bit until there is less shit on it. I then start to stick it up my ass again but this time I scrape against the walls of my anus to get the shit off of there. I don’t stick it that far up in either of these cases. I only scrape against the right wall because for some reason shit never collects on the left. After I am done seeing shit there is where the hard part starts. I put pressure directly onto my buthole and scrape in a multitude of directions until I get most of the shit off. This is difficult because you never know how much shit is actually there and you have to do some really hard scraping to get some of it off. I do one more tp straight up the ass to make sure none remains. Then I rip out a few clumps of ass hair to make sure nothing has collected in  it. This whole process takes between 45 to 90 minutes. It’s the reason I only shit when no one else is in the house or anyone else is asleep. Is this too much work? It just feels so gross ever since I realized how much shit lurks in the crevices of your asshole.,NoStupidQuestions,Am I doing more work than is necessary when wiping my ass?

Second, i never know with girls when i should like ""take charge"" and be dominant or when i should dial it back and just let them take it at their own pace. Im naturally an assertive dude in general, and id prefer to take charge or whatever, but i hate feeling like im pushing a girl or making her uncomfortable, and when i realized that it makes girls uncomfortable or scared or whatever when you do it at the wrong time i decided its best to let them take whatever next step when theyre ready. But this leads to the problem of seeming like a pussy. 

Im a tall dude so when im with a girl who is like a foot shorter than me and i want to kiss her, im like, ""well shit, i dont want her to be like 'oh shit this guy is gonna rape me.'"" Im also kind of oblivious to hints and cues and stuff on top of everything else. 

 And if youre too much like ""no, you go ahead, im gonna sit back and not try to advance this at all,"" nothings ever gonna happen cuz youre gonna seem submissive and weak.

WhiteKoala__,byn6a6," 

The n-word is a very controversial word in today’s current society. Some people believe that since the word has too much negative connotation we shouldn't use it; other people believe that even though it does have a negative connotation, we should still use the word nonetheless. This discussion to me is so unnecessary since you have the choice to be offended or not if you are by this word. It ultimately comes down to whether or not you are effected by someone else's action. People can chose to do what they want to do but they can never control your emotions, only you can. In my personal opinion, I think this debate is not necessary however; both sides do bring up good topics of debate, but I believe that everyone has the right to say the n-word.

“The words is not what holds the power its the conditions that the word existed under.” Akil G from VICE Digital said it best. The word itself does not matter, it is the conditions it was used under. From a modern day perspective, I can clearly see why slavery was immoral and why it was abolished. The owners of slaves did horrible things to them without a doubt but we do not live in those times anymore. We live in the twenty-first century with buildings that go up into the sky, with technology that can reach my grandmother in seconds who is hundreds of miles away. There is no more slavery, well, at least in the traditional sense. Nowadays we are not facing that problem. There are bigger fish to fry in the modern day. These people who are/were so against slavery have no clue that they are supporting indirectly. The clothes on their back were made by a kid in a foreign, third world country who sews the shirt till his hands bleeds then gets paid a few quarters at the end of the day, at best. People want to stay ignorant and not be able to think for themselves because when they do, they are going to find an unpleasant truth that will shake them. Once you people start finding truths in their lives, they have to come to the decision, am I willing to support this or am I willing to spend a few extra bucks and support a more moral company.

Moving on, I find it a bit hypocritical if black people are allowed to say the n-word but other races are not. A Grammy award winning rapper, Kendrick Lamar, is a clear example of this. He lets a young girl come up on stage and sing one of his songs “Maad City”. In this song, there is a verse that uses the n-word, which he is clearly aware of but lets her sing it nonetheless. This poor, intoxicated girl goes up on stage to sing one of her favourite songs by a rapper who she most likely looks up to then gets shot down for singing his lyrics. I was quite astonished about this when I heard about this in class. Kendrick Lamar is a rapper who I do enjoy listening too but I will never be able to look at him the same way. The girl who was up on stage gets hate from the crowd who are all probably saying the n-word as well. Whoopi Goldberg had a very serious argument to this controversy, “Don’t put it in if you do not want people to say it.” I wholeheartedly agree with her. If Kendrick Lamar does not want his “white” fans saying that word, then he should simple not put the lyric in his music. It is almost as if Kendrick Lamar sets up the poor girl. He is clearly capable of knowing that she is white, is a fan, and knows the lyrics. He lets her sing anyway without telling her not to use that word. Something that I find even more interesting than that is when the crowd turns on her. In the full clip of the video, other people were saying the n-word as well but when she gets called out for it, people turn their backs and attack her even though they were doing the same thing. This is a clear example of groupthink.

For my last example of letting everyone use the n-word, Travis Scott brings up a good point, years and years ago, people did not want to see whites and blacks connecting. In the TMZ source, Travis Scott is on stage having a moment with one of his fans. At the end of the clip, Travis Scott express his view towards white people. To my surprise, he was okay with the fan saying the n-word. He knows that if white people and black people want to get anywhere, they are going to have to be equal, and with equality, that means everyone can say whatever they want. “He wasn’t just a white guy, *he was a white guy*”, a person made this comment in the video which makes me wonder, so who has the right to say the word? Black people? White people? Some white people? Everyone?... This argument just brings up even more arguments. 

In class and whilst doing this assignment, I could not find a good argument for having only black people be able to say the n-word. It's preposterous to think that only some people are able to say it because of their skin color and not other people. Racist: *a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.* It’s clear, if you think that only one race has the ability to say it then you are discriminating others for their skin color.

Personally, I object to being labeled one way or another. I’m a male, identify as a male, and am attracted to females. I have both masculine and feminine personality traits, and I would like to understand why I’m labeled a “cis”. To me, it’s offensive to be called that.

When I was in college, one guy even chastised this other guy for shaving his pubes and called him out as gay until 2-3 other guys butted in and told him it's normal and they do it too. 

I live in England and here it's not uncommon to jokingly flirt with your mates. Like if they bring you a drink at the pub ""Cheers babe"" would be an acceptable response, regardless if the two are male. It isn't seen as gay. Making a kiss to your friend (like when you're at opposite ends of the room but you kiss the air in his general direction) is just seen as banter. Do any of this elsewhere and it's seen as gay.

Ik ik, different cultures, but that's not what I'm asking. What I am asking is why are many straight men not confident with their sexuality? It doesn't matter what you do or what is seen as gay or even if you are seen as gay, if you're straight and you know in your head that you're straight, nothing else matters.

None of what I said makes you a homosexual, so why do so many men act uncomfortable with it? Why do they have the perception that it will somehow switch their sexuality, which is impossible.

DepressionThrwA416,c5n8tk,"As title says, I sometimes smell/feel radiation from phones. It's kinda rare that it happens, but occasionally theres a sickly sweet smell that comes from phones that has a warm magnetic feel (as best as I can describe it. Kind of holding a small magnet where it repulses so that slight invisible force feel but really weak). It also had a sticky feel too it as if touching it stuck it to my hands. I dont remember if I could smell if off of that or not.
  
I first felt it on an old Motorola Ravor my dad had and whenever I held it I could feel it. I had trouble talking on that phone because I'd feel it against my face. My dad said he didnt feel anything with it, but every time I held it, without fail, I would feel and smell it. Since then, some smart phones I've had occasionally put off some of it. I can replicate a similar feel if I'm using the phone in bright sunlight, but not as much on the smell.
  
Apart from phones, I've smelt something similar when turning on an old oscilloscope (with a cathode ray tube in it). It was a darker, musty smell compared to the sickly sweet off of phones, but still had the same twinge to it.
  
Honestly I kinda like the smell and when I do smell it on my phone for example, I do everything I can to smell it more. Which in it of itself is kinda weird, but it's a strangely alluring smell for how it smells. Kinda like smelling HCl gas as it isnt good to do, but it sells good so I end up smelling too much of it.
  
So in essence, I smell radiation off of phones and other electronics at times. It's hard to describe smells or how something feels so I hope I did a decent job.
  
EDIT: Follow up question, any idea what it would be besides radiation as the typical radiation is odorless aspect?

I was able to get my bike from my parents’ since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. I was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. Im guessing I’ll have to buy something every few hours so I won’t get kicked out. 

So basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there’s an app or a website for that I’ll take recommendations.




Edit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won’t be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

Edit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I’m extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

A lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

A lot of people were recommending joining the military. I’ve considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)

zenos0,9oeuas,"Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

ftunny,adjdwn,"So I was gifted a [banana hanger](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_ff81f1df-4a66-45aa-8880-7a693f8a9deb?wid=488&amp;hei=488&amp;fmt=pjpeg) recently for Christmas, and while I'm not a huge banana enthusiast, I will occasionally eat them. I bought my first bunch of bananas since receiving the hanger the other day, and I'm down to 2 out of the original bunch of 6 bananas. I went to have a banana with breakfast this morning, but kind of stopped when I realized that would leave me with only one banana left. How would I leave this last banana on the hanger once I break apart these last 2 of the bunch? Should I try to break the stem on the one I'm about to eat particularly low and hope that it leaves enough of a little ""Λ"" on the remaining banana's stem so that it can still hang? Should I just lean the remaining banana against the back bamboo support arch on the hanger and just totally ignore the hook? Or maybe try to stab the hook through the stem on the last banana? I'm not at all sure what the protocol is on a situation like this, totally new to the banana hanger owner world.

R6J11H,8wb2sn,"For the past couple of months, I’ve been working in a restaurant. There’s this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she’s looking through my social media profiles, won’t stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I’ve since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded “don’t you like to be touched?” to which I responded “not by you”. So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said “no chance”. 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said “I’m only joking” before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn’t present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said “dude, isn’t that basically sexual assault?” I responded “is it?” He said “man, she literally molested you and tried again” 

Honestly, I don’t know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she’ll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I’m a man.

My brother does field work in Nigeria, and even tho they earn fraction of fraction what western ""developed"" person earns, they have wide and honest smile. They live happy lives. In the same line, these people have no issue having 5+ children, while these developed not only avoid children, but even prefer living alone (read study that very large percentage of people in scandinavia lives alone in household). I can't even give some theory aside religious one, but I won't delve in it. Yes, one factor might be greed, as it is with me who decided to opt out of children to have more money for me and my wife. But I simply have no clue how can people who have it easy and all kinds of amenities struggle with depression and so many illnesses and stuff whilst people who work for cup of rice have no issue with having 5+ children. Even in times of trouble they smile... It's so mesmerising that it wasn't only cause why I chosen my SO from such country, but it also tempts me to relocate there if only my health ever improves. They struggle with electricity and internet is useless, but yet it's so joyful place to be. I'd give up on internet and any ""developed"" things for such happy life. Interesting fact is that they barely have any treatment there for schizophrenia and other severe illnesses, not because they are in stone age, but because it barely exists. Even women are so much ""warmer"" than any I dated from my country, let alone more ""developed"" world which I didn't even want to try.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is your theory or maybe answer? I'd like to hear as many opinions as possible as answer certainly is more complex than one sentence.

Kate925,caq990,"Personally I am very indescive, I know that this is a negative trait and one that I need to work on to better myself as a person. However, there's this strange sense of joy that I experience when someone else tells me what they want to do. For example, what to eat, what to do or where to go. And it makes me happy to then go and do that thing, to know that they're happy and that they're satisfied. I almost feel like I'm glowing when I feel like I can give this to them.



However when I chose to do something I kind of get this feeling of anxiousness and I begin to constantly worry ""are they actually enjoying themselves, do they even like this food?"" Even if they tell me that they like it, my stomach twists itself into knots wondering ""are they only saying that to be polite?"" I notice that I begin to apologize excessively over every little thing that I perceive could be wrong. I also find myself studying the person that I'm with, their expressions, their tone of voice and every little thing to give me a clue as to whether or not they actually like going to this place, eating this food or whatever we're doing. I almost feel selfish in a way for enjoying myself, and I just find that I absolutely can not relax.



All of that goes away when someone else tells me what they want to do. Of course I have my interests, and I'll voice what I want to do when I want it. But more often than not I find satisfaction in making sure other people are happy.




I can't seem to find an easy way to put this into words, because there is a lot of emotion behind it. Can you help me with that? It would help immensely to be able to communicate this to other people.

Mitch-Pleeze,car9r4,"Long story short, I’ve followed a political account on Instagram for 7 years. The dude &amp; I have been e-buddies on Instagram ever since he only had a few followers.

He launched a merch line last year that’s actually pretty sick. It’s not like he scammed everyone, because he did actually ship out the merch people were buying. Since I’ve followed him for so long, he cut me a deal to buy one of his leather wallets with a skull on it for $45. I asked if he could hold it for me until I get paid (I just launched a business &amp; money is tight.) He said yes.

When I got paid, I shot him a DM and asked if he still had it. He said, “word is bond,” so I paid him over PayPal. Well, long story short, it’s been 3.5 months &amp; he never sent it, and he’s had a few excuses along the way, such as “PTSD issues” (he’s a veteran) &amp; the website messing up.

Now, he’s completely ignoring my messages, ignored my PayPal request for a refund, and ignores my comments when I comment on his posts asking that he respond to my DM. What do I do? I could REALLY use that $45 right now since I have $1.25 in my bank account &amp; I don’t get paid till the 15th.

TL;DR - Bought a wallet for $45 from a guy I’ve followed in Instagram for 7 years. Now he’s ignoring my messages &amp; never sent the wallet after nearly 4 months.

It seems that there is a huge focus in my country (USA) on ""doing what you're meant to do"".  What if ascending to that tier ends up not including the people who have fulfilled your ""Love and Belonging"" tier?

There seems to be a lot of people who are alone/choosing to be alone on their paths to Esteem and Self-Actualization, thinking that they'll find Love and Belonging when they get there -- even that Love and Belonging will stop/hinder them from achieving their true Esteem and Self-Actualization.

On one hand, yes, having a marriage partner/children/etc. could change your ability to do those things.  Like, say, moving somewhere for your dream job but your spouse wants to stay put.    
(I do understand the argument of ""hey OP, love and belonging don't have to come from just those things; it can come from other things too.""  I guess I just defaulted to those because people say lot ""do what you want to do before you marry"".)

On the other hand, Maslow seems to have put those tiers in that order for a reason....  If you don't have Love and Belonging, doesn't it prevent/degrade/undermine the things above it from happening also?

Interestingly women were always allowed to become Khalsa but they have never been the majority nor do they hold the highest authority in the order.

Finally when you become a Khalsa you can use the title of Singh or Kaur which mean Lion and Lioness. Cool.

* What I **DON'T** understand:

Who becomes a Khalsa?, at what age?. In catholicism you have to take classes before participating in certain rituals, are there classes for becoming a Khalsa?, is every Sikh expected to eventually become a Khalsa?.

Also, I understand that joining the Khalsa requires following many rules, like not cutting your hair ever, but I've seen many sikh children who do not cut their hair, are those children Khalsa?.

Also, I've met many sikhs with the surname Singh, where they part of the Khalsa?, or is it simply that some people have that surname independently of whether they are part of the order or not?.

I understand what was the role of the Khalsa warriors back when they were created, but today, what do they do?, are they like the Order of Malta?, a once military organization that became a charity aligned with their original goals?. Do the Khalsa champion freedom of religion across the world like the Order of Malta has hospitals in a ton of countries?.

Or is that being a Khalsa simply means that you are a particularly devout sikh?, or an important member of the sikh community?.

kttarg,carryg,"Hi Reddit,

I’ve got 3 nephews (19, 5 and 2 years old). Today was the 5 year olds birthday so myself, my Mum and their Mum “L” posted a few pictures of our visit to their house on Facebook for our family and friends. My Mum came to my room before I went to sleep and asked me to look at the photos L posted today. Most of the photos were of the 5 and 2 year old but each one had hundreds of likes and comments from strangers (mostly men) saying how beautiful they are and commenting on the family. One person even said “send me a picture of your beautiful children” and someone else wrote their phone number and told L to call them. 

We also saw that L is actually friends with all of them even though they live on the other side of the world to us (we live in the UK). And this is hundreds of people too. My Mum has also being getting a lot of friend requests from the same type of people but has declined them all. She is a bit worried that these strange men are looking at pictures of her grandchildren and commenting on them.

Has anyone come across this before? I’ve looked at some of her older posts and these comments all seem to be from June this year and onwards. 

Since L accepted their friend requests I’m not sure if I should even do anything but it just seems very weird, I know for a fact she doesn’t know these people, there are hundreds! I’d appreciate your opinions on this and some advice on what I should do (if anything at all).

FederalCollege,car79x,"Nearly every time I walk into my local Walmart, there are people buying tons of junk food and then paying using SNAP and other benefits. Am I being misled into thinking they're using these benefits to load up on junk food or is that actually what they're doing? I've seen them sometimes hand the cashier some cash, but nowhere close the amount needed to pay for all the junk food they're buying.

If we don't itemize the benefits, why don't we? Maybe 20 years ago when things were done on paper, it would have been difficult. But merchant sales are now electronic. Supermarkets are already able to electronically add coupons and sale prices. It should be fairly easy to implement this.

Droyk,catfyt,"Yesterday, I bought honey. the cheapest one (Never tasted honey before, first time buying it). after I came home my friend told me, the honey I bought is a processed one, in other words, counterfeit one. after doing a little google-fu, got to know that the honey I bought has added water in it.  it's just a sugary syrup that's all. 

**My Questions are** 

**Q1)** Does the processed honey destroy all the beneficial aspects of raw honey? 

**Q2)** Does the processed honey contain any good vitamins for the human body? the one I bought yesterday is the processed one coz the below tests shows it has water added to it, so should I keep eating that honey? will it provide me with any benefits at all? 

**Q3)** Are the processed and counterfeit honey the same? I mean they are two different naming schemes with different techniques or both are the same just with a different name?

---
because of google-fu, I also got to know that there are ways one can identify the differences b/w the raw honey &amp; counterfeit one/the processed one.

[wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Verify-the-Purity-of-Honey) goes in great detail on how to identify one.

**After reading the methods given by wikihow members I got confused as fuck.**

**1)** ***Examining Honey Before Purchasing:*** In my country, the law is it should be just safe to eat. (your typical 3rd world country); **A Dead END!!**

**2)** ***Check the label:*** This morning I wasted my one hour on this and I am pretty sure that every manufacturer in my area print the label with ""the best the rawest"" no other ingredients were written on it. so possibly all of them could be making a dishonest claim to make money; **Another DEAD END!!** P.S. I know for the fact that there is a super expensive manuka honey &amp; After researching about it, I know how to differentiate b/w manuka honey and it's counterfeits through MGO, NPA, UMF but what about other 300+ kinds of honey that are in the market?

**3)** ***Taste the honey if a sample is offered:*** no one offers it in my country, but just for the sake of it let's say someone gives me a sample for the taste now how would I be able to tell if it's a raw or fake one coz there are 300+ types of honey in the market &amp; they all have different characteristics, different texture, smell, taste, etc. **Another DEAD END!!**

**4)** ***Add a spoonful of liquid honey to warm water after buying to see if it's raw or not:*** I am not too sure about this method I did tried this method on the one I bought yesterday &amp; it got dissolved in the water. so now the reason I am not too sure about this method coz of there are 300+ different kinds of honey, different ways to make them. **How would you know for sure that it's a processed one and  ""dissolving in the water"" it's not one of its characteristics?** *There haven't been any studies to be sure about it*.

**5)** ***Drop honey on your thumb if it's pure it'll stay in one place &amp; if it's not it won't:*** hmm, what if the counterfeits just increase their viscosity by adding different ingredients? or what if it's one of its characteristics? how can you tell?  

**6)** ***A matchstick dipped in pure honey will still be able to ignite when struck:*** I tried this method on the one I bought yesterday and it didn't ignite coz of the added water but what if the counterfeits add different ingredients to make the texture thicker not like a normal honey one &amp; say it's a one of a unique honey now how you can tell if it's real or not?

**7)** ***Set fire to a cotton pad or candle wick dipped in honey to check if there's any added water in it:*** again how would you know that for sure if it's not one of its characteristics. I am not talking about the added water. I am talking about if it has a different texture and a way higher thickness the way it won't be able to burn. I don't know if I am making sense here? 

**8)** ***Drop honey on blotting paper or a paper towel:*** I tried this with the honey I bought yesterday and it did leave a mark coz of the added water. now my question is what if the manufacturer uses different counterfeit material instead of water. how would I be able to point out the difference?

Droyk,catfyt,"Yesterday, I bought honey. the cheapest one (Never tasted honey before, first time buying it). after I came home my friend told me, the honey I bought is a processed/pasteurized one, in other words, counterfeit one. after doing a little google-fu, got to know that the honey I bought has added water in it.  it's just a sugary syrup that's all. 

**My Questions are** 

**Q1)** Does the processed/pasteurized honey destroy all the beneficial aspects of raw honey? 

**Q2)** Does the processed/pasteurized honey contain any good vitamins for the human body? the one I bought yesterday is the processed one coz the below tests shows it has water added to it, so should I keep eating that honey? will it provide me with any benefits at all? 

**Q3)** Are the processed, pasteurized and counterfeit honey the same? I mean they are three different naming schemes with different techniques or all of them are the same just with a different name?

---
because of google-fu, I also got to know that there are ways one can identify the differences b/w the raw honey &amp; counterfeit one/the processed one.

[wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Verify-the-Purity-of-Honey) goes in great detail on how to identify one.

**After reading the methods given by wikihow members I got confused as fuck.**

**1)** ***Examining Honey Before Purchasing:*** In my country, the law is it should be just safe to eat. (your typical 3rd world country); **A Dead END!!**

**2)** ***Check the label:*** This morning I wasted my one hour on this and I am pretty sure that every manufacturer in my area print the label with ""the best the rawest"" no other ingredients were written on it. so possibly all of them could be making a dishonest claim to make money; **Another DEAD END!!** P.S. I know for the fact that there is a super expensive manuka honey &amp; After researching about it, I know how to differentiate b/w manuka honey and it's counterfeits through MGO, NPA, UMF but what about other 300+ kinds of honey that are in the market?

**3)** ***Taste the honey if a sample is offered:*** no one offers it in my country, but just for the sake of it let's say someone gives me a sample for the taste now how would I be able to tell if it's a raw or fake one coz there are 300+ types of honey in the market &amp; they all have different characteristics, different texture, smell, taste, etc. **Another DEAD END!!**

**4)** ***Add a spoonful of liquid honey to warm water after buying to see if it's raw or not:*** I am not too sure about this method I did tried this method on the one I bought yesterday &amp; it got dissolved in the water. so now the reason I am not too sure about this method coz of there are 300+ different kinds of honey, different ways to make them. **How would you know for sure that it's a processed one and  ""dissolving in the water"" it's not one of its characteristics?** *There haven't been any studies to be sure about it*.

**5)** ***Drop honey on your thumb if it's pure it'll stay in one place &amp; if it's not it won't:*** hmm, what if the counterfeits just increase their viscosity by adding different ingredients? or what if it's one of its characteristics? how can you tell?  

**6)** ***A matchstick dipped in pure honey will still be able to ignite when struck:*** I tried this method on the one I bought yesterday and it didn't ignite coz of the added water but what if the counterfeits add different ingredients to make the texture thicker not like a normal honey one &amp; say it's a one of a unique honey now how you can tell if it's real or not?

**7)** ***Set fire to a cotton pad or candle wick dipped in honey to check if there's any added water in it:*** again how would you know that for sure if it's not one of its characteristics. I am not talking about the added water. I am talking about if it has a different texture and a way higher thickness the way it won't be able to burn. I don't know if I am making sense here? 

**8)** ***Drop honey on blotting paper or a paper towel:*** I tried this with the honey I bought yesterday and it did leave a mark coz of the added water. now my question is what if the manufacturer uses different counterfeit material instead of water. how would I be able to point out the difference?

Same with the little mermaid but idc about the little mermaid as much. I understand that they want to be more inclusive and diverse but why do they have to change characters with grounded and already established lore and backgrounds? I would be perfectly happy if they added a new character who was a different race. In my defense though, I would be just as upset if a previously established non white character was changed to white. An example would be if Mulan was white instead of Asian. That just wouldn’t make sense and would be equally upsetting.

One side of the debate, the argument is that female athletes are paid less because their matches make less revenue than their male counterpart. 

On the other side, the argument is that female matches make less revenue because of historical sexism. Women are regarded as inferior athlethes and therefore womens sports are considered to be less entertaining, which in turn means less interest and revenue.

As internet debate goes, there are a lot of opinions but very few academic sources cited. 

Are there any published academic studies out there that studied the factors involved in why female athletes are paid less and how those factors interact with one another?

KLWiz1987,cb2j7x,"So a person has such low energy that they can't work. But really, there are jobs where all the employee does is sit there and sometimes fall asleep and maybe nobody would notice. So the person could work at one of those jobs.

...

The disabled person could collect a monthly disability check. But they could also work at some job as described above. The person could at least appear to be working, and avoid upsetting people for collecting their tax dollars. But here's the hitch. The person doesn't have the energy to apply for thousands of jobs. Even those job apps are too exhausting. It's hard enough for them to tolerate the ride to the jobsite. So even though the person could be earning a living wage and move out of their parents house, they would not be able to get the job in the first place.

...

So what should they do? They could ask on reddit for help, right? Okay, let's say people on reddit give some good advice and the person gets someone to make their resume and signed up for the job apps. What would be the next step after that? The person doesn't have the energy to use the job apps regularly. So many jobs they can't do gets them depressed and avoid the apps. Could it be that the initial effort to get the disabled person a paying job is worth more than the person collecting disability for the rest of their life?

...

So I looked up how much it might cost to help someone get a job. If a family member does it, if they have connections, it's free. Well this person's family members all disrespect the disability and only offer physical labor jobs. So then the person could get help from an agency that supports disabled people, which costs about $6k. That's about a year of disability income, most of which already goes to other things. Okay, so I checked the fundraising methods, and they were all too challenging for the person to stick to long enough to complete them. The government option doesn't work out after several attempts because they expect you to be a hard worker, and they disrespect the nature of the disability. The reddit option has miles and miles of forms to fill out, maybe will return to that later.

...

And it takes so many attempts to ask for advice or help before anyone says anything useful. I can see why someone would get depressed and turn to drugs or alcohol over it.  I can see why the person would start to write more and more hopeless whiney posts and comments whenever they ask questions. I wouldn't blame them for it even though they've made some progress from it once in a while. All people seem to want to do is deny the person's disability and give self improvement tips that don't work for a permanent illness. That would make even a fully healthy person sad.

...

Idk, maybe the person would even be helping the business by doing the job. I'm going to go with employment, somehow, but it seems like someone will have to do a lot of the job search and negotiating. Okay, there may be some kind of grant for people who need help getting employed, but it's a long shot. Would it be better to not stress about all of this, and just hang out in their room with nothing better to do, for the rest of their life, isolated from the outside world?

juliamaan,cb2joz,"Ok, so basically, I have a summer job in a retail store and the manager has made a contract until december 2019 (despite knowing I was only able to work until the 11th of August, as I told her during my job application appointment). I signed it because she told me that it would be ok to resign earlier than the date the contract expires but according to my friends, that's untrue. Furthermore, the manager + all assistant managers are giant assholes, make me work more than the legal amount for 17 year olds (through loopholes) and keep begging me to stay despite knowing that I can't stay due to my uni education starting in September. I just really want to leave.

So, do I write a resignation letter and let them know I'm leaving on the 11th of August? Do I still get the money I worked for up until the 11th of August if I send a letter? I'm so lost and my manager basically refuses to be clear about this.

Ionelygoat,cb37pj,"So I graduated from college in the US last year (non US citizen) and went back to my home country. Thing is, in my home country, to verify your education background, having a diploma isn’t enough. You have to have it “certified” by the Bureau of Education. And employers and government agencies only take that certification as the proof of education. 

In my case, I applied for an extension for one of the homework assignments in the last required class. The plan was, I would hand in my homework late, and after they register the grade, they would give me the diploma at the next available time. Since they only award degrees at the end of every semester, that means I would become a December graduate instead of a May one.

This is where I screwed up. During that half a year period, in order to land a job, I became impatient to wait until December to certify my degree. Being the dumb fuck that I was, I forged a school verification of coursework completion, sent it to the bureau of education and of course, got caught. They reported to my school, which triggered more reaction and a series of academic integrity events. But after intense explanation and coverups, I persuaded them to still give me my degree. But now I really need the government certification for my degree.

Basically there are three parties now: Government bureau of education (shortened as Bureau from now on), my school and me. I know that when the Bureau sent the forged document to the school and asked them did this student graduate, due to privacy reasons, my school didn’t make comments on the document and only stated no, he has not completed his degree. From which statement the bureau asserted that I must have lied. 

From the screenshot of email interactions between the Bureau and school that the Bureau sent me as why they rejected my certification, I know they asked the school “has this student graduated?” Now I can play the game of “completing coursework isn’t equal to graduating, and I only said I completed my courses”. But I’m scared that this will only prompt the bureau to simply send the same forged document to the school again and simply ask “is this document real or not”. I can’t imagine how the school would react after receiving twice a fake document said to be submitted by their graduate. Especially considering the first time was already extremely painful and I almost got expelled.
