       "'TIFU by accidentally humiliating an old friend in social media after he announced he and his wife are having a child. TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nSo I have a friend from high-school that I haven\\'t seen in forever. He is an absolute master of kindness. Driving for two hours to get you out of trouble after not seeing you for over three years type of kindness. Top bloke. Best dude you\\'ll ever meet. Wouldn\\'t hurt a fly. You get the picture.\\n\\nToday he posted a super ecstatic picture of him and his wife with the caption \"About to be a family of three! Finally!\"\\n\\nHis face is big. Double chin kind of big and very unlike him. He was always slim and fit growing up and this just looked fake and not at all like him. It looked so unlike him I automatically assumed this was on of those ridiculous Snapchat filters all the cool kids are using and that he had jokingly used it for a fun twist, so I commented something along the lines of \"Congratulations man! Let\\'s just hope the kid doesn\\'t get your chin lol!\"\\n\\nI close my phone and go back to work. His sister pops up in my chat in the meantime. Tells me he gained a lot of weight from depression, mainly from finding out he was close to being sterile. They\\'ve been trying for a kid for two years, almost breaking up multiple times.\\n\\n I jumped back to my fb to remove the comment only to find out he deleted the entire post.\\n\\nI wanna die. I\\'m on my way over there to apologize. Wish me luck. Or death.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEdit: changed my wording about his appearance. I was in shock when I wrote this and I was an asshole.\\n\\nEdit 2: thanks for confirming my suspicion that I am indeed a fucking moron. I agree. I\\'ll update once something new happens. Surprisingly talking to me isn\\'t his top priority at the moment so you will all have to suffer the wait with me.\\n\\n--\\n\\nEdit 3: The update. The encounter.\\n\\nI sent him a message after I realized I had fucked up. I am a firm believer in apologizing for your mistakes in person and so I simply asked if he\\'d have me over later that day and that I owed him an apology for the childish way I congratulated him on those fantastic news.\\n\\nHe was radio silent for a few hours but just as I was about to step into my shuttle and move from the planet he sent me a message and invited me for a drink at his local bar. \\n\\nI took just about all of your advices. He lives in the next town over so on my way there I bought a bottle of scotch and wrapped it up as a \"congratulations on the baby\" gift instead of \"sorry I fucked up\" one.\\n\\nLong story short I show up and he is super excited to see me. Big bear hug and all. He loves the gift. Chats enthusiastically as we sit down. I expected a punch in the face at best and I am so confused. We spend a little while catching up until I stop him and just straight up apologize for my stupid comment. Tell him I feel awful that I said that and explain I meant nothing by it and how his kid is gonna grow up to be a fantastic piece of human miracle. I\\'m just about to offer my life in return for his apology when he stops me.\\n\\nHis reaction? He stared at me for an eternity (or ten seconds) before he absolutely lost his shit. He laughed so hard I was pretty sure he was gonna run out of air and die right there. He\\'s holding his stomach and his laugh is so intense it turns into one of those silent wheezing sounds that only dogs can hear.\\n\\nTurns out he didn\\'t even see my comment. His wife deleted the original post because some ex of hers was posting shit and then posted it again on her private wall (friends only). Yeah. She posted it and and tagged my friend, not the other way around. She also seems to have just deleted my comment without telling him before that or something. What a fucking saint that woman is.\\n\\nSo. No harm done. I showed him this thread and he didn\\'t stop laughing for about two hours. He shared this on his Facebook and tagged me and got his revenge that I so generously handed to him on a silver plate because he didn\\'t even fucking know. You guys. He didn\\'t even know. He doesn\\'t care. He thinks my original comment was hilarious. He is a little pissed at his sister for contacting me and making it look like I wrecked havoc.\\n\\nSo yeah. I just arrived home drunk, tired and super fucking happy that this couple is having a kid. He\\'s gonna be the best dad ever (whatever his chin looks like).\\n\\nThanks for joining me on this roller coaster Reddit. I\\'ve learned my lesson.\\n\\nEdit 4: no guys, I didn\\'t drive home drunk. I took a taxi.\\n\\nTL;DR Today I told my depressed, close to sterile friend I hope his miracle baby doesn\\'t inherit his ugly face. Now I need to move to Mars.'"
