How did I fuck up? Well, now I have to support the darn thing!

I greatly enjoy reading stories that are posted on subreddits like /r/tifu.
What I like less is reading these on my computer. Both old and new reddit put too much clutter around text and the formatting itself always feels less than ideal for long pieces of text. 

A while ago I had a realization *""I can fix this!""*,  which is what I promptly set out to do. I started out with a bit of custom css, then I realized I could do better with some scripting. That sort of spiraled out of control and before I knew it I had made it in a full blown browser extension.  

# So what does this extension do?

**tl;dr** it adds beautiful and clean reading mode to reddit posts and comments!

The extension takes text posts or comments and transforms the text from [this](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c37109ddbe6c.png) into something more readable with less distractions [like this](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3ba528d9dbe.png)

Or if you are more into dark themes [it will actually look like this](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3ba502b7c7c.png)

It is even somewhat ""smart"" about how it grabs the text, so when you encounter one of those authors who didn't have enough space and needed to continue as replies to their original story it will also include the text from those comments! It does this by going over the comments in posting order, picking those made by the author (if there are any) and adding those to the story. It repeats that for child comments until the entire story has been combined. 




# Features

- Works on both old and redesigned reddit.
- Has a light and dark mode.
- Allows you to choose your own font.
- Adjustable font size.
- Adjustable text width. 
- Works on both text posts and comments. 

[Screenshot of the settings](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3ba55f5d996.png)

# Downloading it

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/readable-text-posts-on-reddit/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readable-text-posts-on-re/kpffhggoghnmcbofgjdccdgflkodakkj)

# So how do I make it work? 

There a few methods actually! You can activate it for a text post, all the top level comments in a post or just one specific comment. 

Activating for a text post or all the top level comments is done through the [floating button](https://creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c370f60503b6.png) on the bottom right corner when you are visiting a post. Once you hover over it [you get to choose between text posts or comments](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3a68c84cc4e.png). 

If you just want to read an individual comment you can click on the ""read"" link that has been added to it. 


# Open source

The thing is entirely open source, the [source can be found here](https://github.com/creesch/readReddit). 

# Future plans 

- Make the button position a setting. 
- Setting to only show the button in selected subreddits
- Custom themes.

lamullen,ca2oxv,"As per usual this didn't happen today but this past Saturday. I (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I'm pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don't respond. Most of my friends see me and think I'm joining, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I'm stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I'm placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks! 

Tldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press

RaidCan,c9uput,"This FU happened about 6 years ago, but I still think about it to this day. 

I was a student studying at a big university that had some large, luxury apartment buildings nearby for students to live in after their freshman year. In my building, there were around 400 apartments across 8 floors. I lived in one of these apartments with three roommates. Modern gym, stainless steel appliances-- nice place. 

The FU starts with me not wanting to drink my face off for once on a Saturday and wake up the next morning feeling like a train wreck, and instead wanting to have a ""wholesome"" night of fun. So instead of going out, I decided to post signs around the building that a dinosaur, specifically a Velociraptor, was on the loose. Harmless, right?

I spent some time putting this [flyer](https://imgur.com/iGBTDIw) together, purposely making it ridiculous by adding phrases like ""look out for the Velociraptor mating call"" and ""ask security for repellent""-- I figured people would laugh about it. Then I walked down to the apartment building's lobby to use their free printing and make about a hundred copies. Finally, starting at about 9 PM, I spent the next two hours posting the sign on various doors around the building. 

For better or worse, it was a Saturday, and people were getting drunk. About halfway through my adventure, as I was getting into the elevator to change floors, I saw a girl dressed to go out, makeup done, on the phone with someone, tears streaking her mascara as she struggled to convey to someone that there ""had been a velola-raptor attack and that she didn't know what to do."" Me at the time thought this was really funny and kept going, and ultimately, after posting my hundred flyers, I went back to my apartment, watched some TV, and went to bed. That Sunday I spent most of my time doing homework and not leaving my room.

On Monday while in class my roommates' group text lit up with ""Does anyone know what [this](https://imgur.com/SnOsyEW) is? It was a pile of 4 ""Notice[s] of Lease Violation"" suggesting someone had caused a ""disturbance on the property"" and that there would be a fine. Me being fairly young, I got spooked, bounced from class, and biked to my apartment to take care of it.

I grabbed the notices and went to the leasing office. I'll shorten it immensely,  but the conversation can be summarized as such:

Me: ""Hi, I got these notices at my apartment today about causing a disturbance. I was wondering what it's about?""

Apartment Agent: ""Oh, so it's you."" Calls out to someone outside his office: ""Get in here ""Other Apartment Agent,"" it's the dinosaur boy!""

OAA, a guy trying too hard to be serious: ""Do you know what you did last night?""

Me: ""Yeah, I just posted some funny and clearly harmless signs around that there was a dinosaur on the loose. Also it was just me, so don't include my roommates here.""

OAA: ""Okay, just you, but it was neither funny nor harmless. Do you know how many calls security got? I had parents calling in demanding to know about the situation. We had students asking if there was a bunker to hide in.""

Me, a little bewildered: ""Uh, the sign said Velociraptor. Dinosaur. Clearly extinct. It was just a joke. How did people take that seriously?""

OAA: ""Look, *I know* Velociraptors have been dead for over 10,000 years, but you caused a disturbance, and I still have to fine you.

*10,000 years*. Fuck. There would be no winning with this guy. I asked him what the fine was ($100), ran back up to write a check, and paid it. (Note: They apparently knew it was someone in my apartment who posted the signs by following security footage).

To this day I wonder how many fully functioning adults at prestigious universities think Velociraptors are real, that they aren't dinosaurs but are instead a vicious reptile that people illicitly keep as pets or that you can go see at the zoo. I also occasionally wonder about the panic I caused, thinking about the girl who was likely on the phone with her parents, and all her parents probably heard were ""someone died -- on the loose -- don't know what to do."" 

I still laugh about it.

TL;DR: Posted signs around my building saying that a velociraptor killed someone and was on the run. Freaked out my drunk building and management got involved. Got fined $100.",tifu,TIFU by convincing my entire apartment building a velociraptor was on the loose
MisterGamenWatch1985,c9yaj1,"so this happened last week. It's just been in the back of my head trying to process that it actually happened. So I'm bi and I use Grindr occasionally. So the night before I get a a message from a guy (26m) asking if I (33m) wanted to come over and I declined because I had work at 6 the next day, but maybe after I was off if he was still awake I'd go by. So we chat throughout the day because I'm currently looking for a FWB who's local and not a tweaker. So I decided that after work I'd go and get some head. So he gives me his address and when I get there I see a car in the drive way and it looks familiar but I see a ton of cars everyday that look like the one in the drive way so I shrug it off. So he lets me in and we promptly go to his room. I asked if his roommates were home because we kind of rushed to the room. So he says oh yeah I live with my mom and asks if that's okay. I said yeah and asked if I had to be quiet or whatever and he said no so we proceed having fun. So fast forward I'm about to have actual sex with him and on the side of the bed is a picture of him and his mom. So I got less aroused. Why you ask? Because of a picture of him and his mom? No, because only a few months earlier I asked his mom my former coworker(56f) for HER NUMBER and we were actually talking about going out for drinks and possibly hooking up but it never went anywhere. AND NOW I'M GETTING HEAD FROM AND HAVING SEX WITH HER SON IN HER HOUSE.... WHILE SHE IS IN THE KITCHEN DOING DISHES. So naturally I still finished. As I'm getting ready to leave I hear her voice and the guy asks if  I want discretion as I leave. THANK GOD HE ASKED THAT. As calmly and faking not being uncomfortable I say please, he steps out first tells his mom to go to her room for a sec and she agrees. I left and he hit me up later saying he had a good time. I lied and said I did too.

TL ; DR - Went for a casual hookup, turned out to be the son of a former coworker, who I also happened to have interest in the past. Hooked up in her house while she was in the kitchen doing dishes. Still finished.",tifu,TIFU By sleeping with my former co-worker's adult son.

So this afternoon my husband and I had a quickie before leaving to run errands. I let him finish in my mouth and we cleaned up, got dressed, and left the house. 


On our way down the driveway my husband was flirting with me and says ""Give me some sugar"". So I go over to him to give him a kiss and he takes a step back away from me (he teases me like this). So I keep trying to kiss him, getting up on my tippy toes to reach him. He takes another step back saying ""No, what is this? I don't want this! I asked for sugar! You know, the white stuff??"" 


So my dumbass laughs and loudly says ""I can't give that to you I already swallowed it!"" (I think I'm hilarious apparantly and was proud of my response).


All he says back is ""The neighbors just heard you say that"". 


So I turn my head and see my neighbors (an older couple) sitting in the very front of their garage about fifteen feet away. We lock eyes. It was clear they heard the whole exchange and knew what I meant. Up to this point I've been almost too shy to say hello in the mornings, now I don't even want to go back outside. I don't know how to come back from this guys.

englishbyname,ca8rz4,"This happened today!

The street I live on has a lot of CCTV coverage on it from various houses thanks to us being targeted by criminals a couple of years ago causing everyone to be ultra paranoid, as such the street's Facebook group is like a modern day neighbourhood watch. The past week there have been a couple of cars broken in to so everyone is extra alert at the minute.

I bought a 3D printer last week and got it set up over this weekend. After a few test prints I finally started to print my first project today, as it's due to be going for 18 hours I thought this afternoon was a good time to leave it to its own devices and go out somewhere with the family.

So the FU is that I set the house alarm when I left the house and the movement of the printer set the alarm off - I have no idea how long it was going off for but I was out for a couple of hours, so probably ruined everyone's quiet Sunday afternoon sat in the garden. One thing is for certain though, this street is extra vigilant on social media, but in real life there's nobody to be seen at a time of potential criminal activity.

Also, now my wife isn't talking to me because she feels so embarrassed.

loserposerboboozer,ca7mz6,"So this happened yesterday. I was horny and hoping to get my partner to help me with that.

For a little background: we spend a lot of time apart due to work - I mean like 80-90% of our time is spent apart. The only way to really fulfill our relationship is to get off to/with each other.

Well, last night, as per the title, I asked partner what his biggest, darkest, dirtiest fantasy is, hoping for something kinda kinky, or a threesome or something a bit wilder. At first he said he didn’t have one, but I know everyone has something they wish they could do but can’t, or that they want to do but are too embarrassed to bring it up. So I pushed him.

Then he confessed he would like a threesome... with my sister.
 I asked if he was serious, or if he was just trying to illicit a shocked response from me. His answer: “Both.”

Wellll, I guess it’s my fault for asking. I was a bit tipsy and definitely horny. Needless to say, that completely killed my buzz and now I don’t know how to proceed. I didn’t contact him or respond to him after that, as I kinda just felt sick and I don’t know if I’m going to want to have sex with him when we finally do reunite. Go me!


Tl;dr : I was drunk and horny, insisted that my partner tell me his darkest fantasy, and found out he wants a threesome with my sister. 

P.S. obviously I realize it could’ve been something actually really, truly dark, but I’d rather have not known (in any way, shape or form) that my SO wants to get it on with my sibling - WITH ME.

Ragnadrok,ca5yhs,"I live at home with my parents, and just a bit ago I felt like having a shower. There are few times that I can sneak my fleshlight out of my room to clean it, so the best times are when I shower. Figured I'd clean it out real quick, shower, make a sandwich, then watch a bit of Stranger Things before bed. I finished cleaning my toy and myself, dressed in the bathroom, then went out to make my sandwich, placing my used towel and dirty clothes in a chair. Halfway through making it, I heard my parent's door open, followed by the bathroom door closing.  At this moment I was just super jazzed about making my delicious sandwich and could already taste the goodness. 
My mom comes out and sits in the living room, watching some Facebook video on her phone. We talk briefly before I finish my making my sandwich, I say goodnight and head to my room. Once in, I put my sandwich on the desk and start to set up when I remember I forgot my towel and clothes, and then it hits me. The fucking fleshlight. 
When I go out to the living room, my mom is still watching whatever video. I grab my towel then head to the bathroom, hoping that I had at least been smart enough to draw the curtain closed, but of fucking course, I had not. One glance into the shower, and you see the fleshlight laying proudly on the sill of the tub in all its pink silicon glory. 
I only give myself a couple seconds to tell myself how much of a goddamned idiot I am before I grab it, wrap it in my towel, then make a show of loudly grabbing and rinsing out my shower cadey, letting the hard plastic clank quite a bit as I did so. Then I headed back to my room where I gave myself quite a bit more time to call myself an idiot. It's been about a half hour, and she hasn't come to talk to me about it, and I'm hoping she doesn't, kinda embarrassing. 
Anyway, hoping I could give y'all a bit of a laugh at me, I'm already laughing quite a bit at myself.

an_electrocardiogram,c9qiqq,"So this happened earlier in the week but is NSFW so posting on the weekend. Also on my throwaway acc. since I don't want this story going back to the IRL me.

So at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. I'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. It never has and so I took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

Anyway, I'm on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I'd open the wrapper since I'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

As I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.

When I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.

I wish I could delete memories and that I'd never remembered/realised this.

TL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I've tasted condoms before.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. I have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. I think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

I think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" I'm also from New Zealand, not North America as a few have assumed. Here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

The ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

thrwawyubot,ca8l3e,"Ofc this didn’t happen yesterday...

I’ve just realized this recently because I was talking to a couple of my friends about the cost of all the lunches throughout our public school careers thus far. One of my friends mentioned how we had to factor in the cost of milk. I then mentioned how weird it was milk was free throughout elementary school, and then became a dollar in middle school. This is when I realized my fuck up.
At my elementary school, (apparently) you needed to buy a ticket in the morning that you would then hand to a cafeteria lady so you could grab a milk from the carton in the front of the cafeteria. 
What I did, because I was a stupid little 5-11 year old, was I would go through the lunch line, get my food but not grab a milk, and then after I sat down with my food I would then get up and grab my milk at the front of the room. By doing this, I didn’t have to give a ticket to get milk. I did this for almost SIX years without getting caught. 190 days a year, milk being $1, for six years (kindergarten through 5th grade) is $1,150 worth of milk I took from my school. RIP.

Some backround: I(21M) recently started working as reception in a pretty good hotel. This is my second(actual job) ever and the last one I had was an office job where I didn't have contact with customers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where the story starts. I usually work the late shift so not a lot of people to deal with but today was election day and the morning shift(my superior\[\~45F\]) wanted to take the day off to go vote. So naturally I took her shift. In come an elderly couple that have had a reservation. I check the system and it shows that they have payed \~750euros for 10 nights and they were assinged the room 111(which has Garden view). I take them to their room and the moment I show them inside they start going nuts telling me that's not the room they reserved and that they are gonna leave if they don't get the room they payed for. Naturally I panic and tell them I'll try to sort it out as soon as possible. Since the price was quite high I assumed they weren't lying about them paying for another room so I didn't check*(I know I'm retarded)*. I call my superior but she doesn't answer so I take things upon my self to fix this issue*(yeah I know I'm retarded)*. I speak with cleaning staff and ask if there is a room available with Sea view that is cleaned and there was one. I tell them that I fixed the mistake and escort them to their new room. After a few minutes my superior calls and I explain everything. She gets MAD. Like REALLY MAD. Yeah turns out a room with a sea view that's really close to the sea in a 4(?) start hotel does not in fact cost 75 euros per night. And I was in fact correct in putting them in the garden view room.

Azrynix,ca2jec,"So I introduced my dad to Steam about 4-5 years ago and it made his life. We always used to go to our local game stores and look for those hidden gems in the 'sale' bin, but after that he had all the games he could ever want at his fingertips.

I created the Steam account for him, and told him to finish setting up his profile whenever he felt like. He never did, so his profile just comes up with an error when you look at it, and you can't view his library of games or wishlist. As you can imagine, this makes buying games for him a shot in the dark.

However, I found out a workaround several months ago. If I find a game he has on his wishlist, it will show that in the sidebar of the game description, and I can click on that to get to his wishlist. So considering that the Steam Summer Sale is currently on, I thought that I would buy him some games using this method. It was innocent enough at first. Kenshi, Xcom 2, Total War, etc. Then I decided to change the filter to ""date added"". This is where I fucked up.

It started off simple enough, just some indie titles and yet to be released games. But then there were some.... questionable titles. We're talking "" Naughty Maid 2"", ""Cyber City Life 18+"", and even some furry related stuff?? It was then I realized that my dad doesn't know that I can see his steam wishlist. I quickly changed the filter back to ranked order, found some games, and sent them as gifts. I will likely never forget that my dad is still sexually active and likes porn games.

Valentari,ca6oyr,"This actually happened in a combination of last night and today.

 I've been a type 2 diabetic (or I guess pre-diabetic?) for a couple years now and I cut most of the carbs and all of the sugar out of my life back when I was diagnosed in 2015. I used to test my blood sugar every day but once I cut all the bad stuff out, my A1C's dropped drastically and my blood sugar was where it was supposed to be (so long as I took my low-dose Metformin).  Over time, I got lazy, I stopped checking my blood sugar because my readings were always great and I wasn't eating carbs, so what did it matter?

However, I have random days where I feel just...weak, tired, or ""not right"" and on those days, the first thing I do is check my blood sugar to make sure I'm not having a weird spike day. I had one of those ""not feeling right"" days last weekend and so I checked my blood sugar: 287! That had me freaked out so I immediately posted to r/diabetes and asked for advice on if I should go to the ER or not. They suggested doubling my dose of Metformin and fasting and exercising to lower my blood sugar. I did all of these things for a week, testing my blood sugar after every meal and before bed. My readings were all high: 190-280 at all times, no matter what I did.

I then realize I was running low on test strips so I ordered a box from Amazon. It arrived yesterday and I tested my blood sugar: 121. ""That's weird"" I thought. Then I looked at the container my old strips were in. They had an expiration date printed on them. They expired at the end of 2015. I looked around in my room for a spare and I found one of my old expired ones that was unused, tested again: 235. So yes, the cause of my worries for the past week was not that my body was suddenly not producing enough insulin, it was expired test strips.

It never even occurred to me that little bits of plastic would have an expiration date, or that them being expired would cause drastically incorrect readings. Of course, now it makes perfect sense, since they probably use enzymes or something to determine the sugar levels and chemicals break down over time. I tested again this morning to confirm, and my blood sugar is sitting at a nice 98, which I can live with.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Didn't know glucose test strips could expire, or that they would give woefully incorrect readings when expired, thought my diabetes had mutated into super diabetes overnight, spent an entire week panicking, exercising like a madman, and fasting for long intervals. New, unexpired test strips arrived, and I am perfectly fine.",tifu,TIFU By Not Realizing Glucose Test Strips Have An Expiration Date!

As soon as I walk in to the bathroom I start to vomit allover. It got on the walls, the floor, allover the toilet and some got in the shower. At this moment I started to feel really embarrassed. But her father and i started to clean everything up and i went back to bed with my ex. And also as the icing on the cake her twin(f)(not identical) saw everything and laughed right in my face.

Just a short back story. Was bullied from 1-10th grade I started high school. Then life got better. Now in my 30s. Im also colored. I have a masters degree, I do charity work, don't have a record. Overall a good, robust guy. 

I had just finished a night shift. I bicycle and went home, but was too awake to actually fall asleep, so I decided to go fishing (quite normal where I live).  I was fishing for a few hours when a speed boat came very close and started pulling my line with him. I kinda panicked and started waving to this guy who just ignored me and went to dock his boat. I came up to where he was and explained what happened and that it wasn't cool that he just ignored me and almost made me lose my rod. 

He came off and acted all tough. Started swearing to me. I told him I would push his boat out of he didn't calm down. He grabbed me. I froze. I don't know what happened. But this triggered something from my childhood. I called the cops on him, they came and I told them what happened and that he ended up assaulting me. With at least 20 witnesses around. 

The police told me that he hadn't assaulted me. And that I had to leave the premises and not return. I told them there's at least 20 eye witnesses around watching. They said no one saw him assault me. They told me it was my fault what had happened. Now I was having a proper mental meltdown. I didn't know what to do and I felt helpless. I saw another police patrol and told them what had happened, and they just said yeah we don't believe you, gtfo. 

I usually don't drink. I had stopped. I went to the liquor store, bought a flask of vodka. I started chugging it. Keep in mind that the time is now around 2-3 PM. 

After that I don't remember a thing. I woke up at the hospital. They told me I had been in an accident with my bike. They did a head CT because I was so far out. But they concluded that I had just consumed way too much alcohol. I had bruises and cuts everywhere and was bleeding quite a bit. 

The next morning the police came to the hospital and took me to their station to press charges.

This whole time my phone battery was dead. I hadn't been able to contact anyone, especially my fiance (long distance). I told her I was in an accident and left out the part about being drunk. She asked me a few hours later if I had taken anything, and then I told her the rest of the story. She is now rethinking everything.

When I was younger, I had a nasty ear infection and I got this bottle of eardrops. It was white bottle with green cap. Later on, I got a eye infection and the bottle of eyedrops from my doctor was, coincidently also white with a green cap. I stuck both bottles in the fridge for about 7 months. 7 months later, when I got an eye infection I took the ear drops and thought they were eye drops. I later found out that my sister had used my eyedrops and threw them away, but me being hardly able to open my eyes I didn't read the info on the bottle. When I dripped the eardrops into my eyes, the only way I can describe the pain is fire. It was searing hot I couldn't even open my eyes. At this point I thought it was just the medicine burning the same way ointment burns onto bare flesh. The medicine didn't help me at all. Over the next few years, I kept buying the same bottle and used them as eyedrops. I just visited the doctor and told him the ""eyedrops"" I used stings, and he looked at me weirdly and told me they were eardrops.

This FU happened somewhere around three years ago when i was still in high school. In those days, i was a casual drug user, mostly just smoking weed every other day and then doing cocaine and other party drugs on some weekends. I had it under control, is what i'm saying. However, i was quite unexperienced and childish when it came to working.

I was working at a grocery store close to my house where i had developed a reputation for calling in sick quite frequently. Probably three times a month or so. Its relevance to the story is that, i had planned an acid trip with my friends on a work day, which was a problem i would normally have solved by calling in sick. And i would have, had i not done that four days earlier. My solution was this.

I was on the ""short shift"", a three hour shift between 16:00 and 19:00 pm. My friends suggested that i'd take the acid as soon as i finished my shift. Not wanting to take the blotter that late, considering that trips can last twelve hours, i decided that i would drop the tab at the start of the shift. I was expecting it to kick in after an hour, and then i would try to last the rest of the shift before meeting up with the guys after work. My friends advised against this plan, but i  didn't want to ruin the day so i just went by my gut. I had done acid one time before, and that trip had gone by quite smoothly, so i naively thought that i just had some natural talent when it came to handling psychedelic drugs.

Arriving at work five minutes early, i said hello to my co-workers and my boss and went straight to the bathroom. I dropped the acid, put my work t-shirt on and went to the register with a smile on my face, ready to provide good customer service. Now, like i said, i had expected the tab to kick in after about an hour. It had last time, and after kicking in, it had also taken the drug quite a while to ""peak"", so i had some confidence that this would be a somewhat uneventful shift. Well, you can imagine how surprised i was when, after about 30 to 45 minutes, i was tripping absolute balls. I was still able to do my job for about ten minutes, but things were starting to look pretty bleak when i couldn't open a bag for an elderly lady because i literally felt as if the bag was dripping of my fingers. People's faces were melting, my ears were detecting some weird sounds that i had never heard before, and i was sweating profusely.

I ran to one of my co-workers, a girl two years my senior, and asked her if she could cover me while i went to the bathroom. I didn't even wait for her to answer because i was starting to feel as if i was about to puke. I ran straight to the bathroom and locked myself in, hoping that i could at least buy myself some time. Looking at myself in the mirror, i didn't even recognize myself. I looked like a totally different person. I sat down by the toilet, breathing like a mad man. Things were getting worse. The bathroom floor had this weird pattern on it and the drugs effects caused it to move in this floating motion, making me feel like i was sinking. I remember thinking to myself that the tabs must have been of some insane potency, because my first trip had been nothing like this. I heard someone knocking on the door. My boss. He asked if i was okay, and i replied by saying that i was taking a shit. I heard him whisper "" For fuck's sake"", before going back upstairs.

After spending some time calming myself down, i went back to work. Again, things were going okay for a few minutes, and i was starting to feel hopeful that i could actually do this. My problems resurfaced when a customer asked me if i was feeling okay. I looked up and noticed how the whole line of customers were staring at me. I asked him what he meant. Apparently i had been staring at the cash register screen for some time, completely frozen, not paying any attention to what i was doing. Freaking out, i left the customers and went straight to my boss. I told him that i was starting to develop flu-like symptoms and that i had to go home. He turned around and flipped out on me, telling me how i was the most irresponsible person he had ever met. I said something along the lines of, ""Well, your entitled to your own opinion"" before turning around and starting to walk out of the store. To my horror, he grabbed my arm and turned me back around, staring into my eyes. He inspected me for a while, and asked me why my pupils were so big. I ripped myself free and told him that i had allergies. Then i proceeded to run out of the store.

I met up with my friends later on, who were, according to them, having the best trip of their lives. The rest of my trip was horrible, since i was never able to shake of that terrible feeling i had at the store.

I was supposed to show up to work three days later. As you would expect , i was feeling quite anxious when i arrived that day. I had built up all kinds of scenario's in my head where i was yelled at in front of the entire staff, or something even worse. But that's the thing. No one, not a single one of my co-workers including my boss, ever mentioned anything about my suspicious behavior three days earlier.  My boss simply said ""good morning""  with a smile on his face and that was that.

It still mind-boggles me to this day.

mrminesheeps,ca99ex,"So this happened today, believe it or not. I... Need someplace to vent. TL;DR at the bottom, for those who want to find out about my sorrows the easy way. 
So, me and Sarah (the fake-name I'm giving for her) have been in a relationship for a few years now. About, say, two and a half years. We had a really strong relationship. But her parents went through a divorce, which I helped her through. The struggles she was living with for so long. She told me, she doesn't know where she'd be if it wasn't for me. But eventually, she had to move with her mom to Ohio. This is where things started going South, unbeknownst to me. She started texting me less. For context, she had an ex-bf she used to talk to. She began talking to him again sometime after she moved. At first, it was as friends. But somehow, Douchebag (the name of that ex-bf) had managed to wrench her from me. She slowly began to love him again. And for some reason, she kept it going. As far as I was aware, we were still as close as ever. But I found it strange that she wasn't responding to me as often. We eventually planned for me to visit her for 4 weeks over the summer. And two weeks ago by this coming Monday, I arrived at her house. I could tell something was off. I'd had suspicions of something between those two. As the days went on, this started seeming more evident. But I was certain it was nothing. But come today, I had woke up early in the morning, and I went to go sleep somewhat close to where she was in her room. I woke up a few hours later, she was still asleep. I saw her phone. Knowing me, I felt like it'd be funny if I messed with it a bit. So I had my grand scheme in mind. I log into her phone, just to discover her Discord open. And what I saw on her messages felt like I was stabbed in the heart. I saw her latest messages to Douchebag. And instinctively, I kept scrolling. My heart hurt more and more. My beliefs about her had begun crumbling. And then I found it. A message of her calling herself his gf. That did it for me. My happiness, snapped like a damn twig under a semi truck. And the messages were like each individual wheel rolling over that twig twofold. I threw her phone down onto her bed, wrote a message for her on paper, saying I've seen her messages. I had, at this point, already wrote a long message asking her what the hell she did that for. I wanted to talk to her. What ended up happening, eventually, no matter what I said, was that she no longer had the same feelings. That's it. And worse yet, I'm stuck here for another two weeks. She had lots of friends. Close friends. All of which held close friendships and honesty dearly. They'll find out soon. I can't keep my mouth shut forever. They'll know. And when they do, they'll likely hate her. I don't want that, I still love her. But it's inevitable. She feels really bad for it, and she knows what she did is wrong. I want to forgive her, but I can't seem to muster the strength to do so. My heart is pounding just by typing this. It's like I'm reliving my worst nightmare. She's pretty much made it clear where we stand. She wanted to end it on her own terms, but here we are. She wanted to still be friends. I want that, but I'm certain my emotions won't allow it. It feels good venting. But I'm not going to have a good time for these last two weeks. Its not like I can cut the trip early. My round trip was called to be four weeks. I don't think I can keep myself together here much longer. I'll go ahead and write the TL;DR, and get off Reddit for now. I need to think.

Hello everyone, This is my first time posting on this subreddit, they shouldn't be any speling mistaks, my English is very ""well"" so don't wory

Anyway, storytime...

So I was testing the sharpness of my knife, (you know that kind by cutting a paper) with this very sharp black knife of mine, but for some reason, I was lifting the knife pretty high, (I'm guessing you can kind of see where this is going) I kept accidentally tearing the paper, and eventually gave up with my one knife and switched over to my ""Swiss Army Knife"", So I was testing my other knife and eventually raised it really high up and took a massive swing towards the paper...

(Luckily I switched over to my Swiss Army Knife or a third of my finger would have been chopped off for good)...

It hit my finger, and I quickly dropped my knife and I'm like ""Ok don't worry probably just a small cut don't worr- OH SHIT!"" In my head, the cut was so deep it cut a little bit of my tendons off! (Note: this was my pointer finger on my left hand)

Well, don't worry it didn't hurt that much, I kind of get how people in movies are fine after getting shot after this...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this the night after this event happened and I can't bend the top of my finger! You know that crease close to your nail, well, that is a part of the chunk I cut off, now there's a huge hole in my left finger and this is what's creepy about it:

* It smells weird, (don't ask why I smelt it)
* I might lose feeling in the top of my finger,
* I can't bend the top of my finger,
* I can see my flesh!

The coolish things:

* Once my flesh and skin goes back there isn't going to be a crease for a while,
* I have something to boast about,
* I get to post on this subreddit and hope to get in one of ""~~RSLASH~~'s"" video's

If this gets enough upvotes maybe I will give links to my: Black Knife, (sharp) Swiss Army Knife, and the big hole in my finger,

So, for the past year or so, I haven’t upgraded my wardrobe at all. I’m not a shopping kind of guy, and my clothes typically reflect that. I’m not bothered, though, I just don’t put clothes on the top of my list of importance. 
Anyhow, I decided to buy some new pants, as mine have been getting worn from work and such. Just general fading and wear. 
So I pick up identical pants. Same brand, same style, literally the same pants in the same size. Wrangler comfort fit with the lightly stretchable waist band. Stretches like an inch or so for comport. Pretty nice imo. 
So I buy them and take them home without trying them on, since I know my size and they are identical. 

Holy shit, I can’t get them past my thighs. 
Ok, maybe they changed something...
So I grab a larger size at the store and try them on in store. 
Same thing. 
What in the fuck...

I visually compare my pants to the new ones side by side. 
I shit you not, my pants are like 8 inches larger in circumference. 
They don’t LOOK stretched out or anything. They just look like regular pants for god sake, but alas... My bathroom scale isn’t very accurate, but it appears I’ve gained maybe 20lb. I don’t have a solid number yet. I’m buying a new scale tomorrow. 

You’re probably wondering “How the fuck did you go a year and not realize you got so fat”. 
To which I reply with a pained whimper, pretty much. I have not the slightest inclination. 
Well, I mean, I guess I do. 
I’m overweight to begin with, and don’t really weigh myself. I haven’t noticed no changes in anything I do, per se, and my clothes weren’t APPARENTLY getting tighter, so it slipped my radar I guess. What the fuck....

So my “panic attack” over this has halfway subsided, and I plan a half-way aggressive weight loss plan to not only return to normal overweight status, but perhaps get down to a healthier weight in general. I downloaded a calorie tracking app and I’m hoping I can lose around 100lb or so within a year. I’ve tried and failed, but this appears to be the straw that does it. I will commit 110%, and this post will remind me. 
I’m done with being overweight. 

That said, if anyone has any tips for me on achieving my goal, you have my full attention, and I thank you in advance.

InsidiousZombie,c9wqa1,"Obligatory not today but during my senior year of high school. tl;Dr available at bottom. 


You'll need some backstory. So, let's go back to little old me in my basic metals class. Now, we were fortunate enough to have these metal workshops stuffed with welding and metal working equipment. It gave us a lot of opportunities and was one of my more favorite classes I took throughout high school. Teacher was great, my peers in the class weren't the worst and I did rather well at it and it was good at waking me up being I took it at 7 am.

We had three different options for welding in the classroom. MIG welding, TIG welding, and oxy-acetylene welding. I had already completed the other two for my project, and it was time for me to use oxy-acetylene. It was my favorite because it's basically a blowtorch system that uses an oxygen tank and an acetylene gas tank, which you ignite to heat and weld the metal.

So, when you're using a tank system, eventually the tank runs out. No problem, right? I told Mr. Teacher man and he replaces the acetylene tank in a quick 5 and I go back to working on it. The torch is feeling very funky and doesn't seem to be working well, but it's whatever I'll figure it out. I set up the equal oxygen and acetylene stream amounts, and ignite it.

I press it to the small strips of metal and begin heating them. Now, sometimes the torch will spark and it's entirely normal. So it did that. But this time, I watched one single spark fly and land on top of the acetylene tank. I watched it ignite (it had not supposedly not entirely been tightened) and I watched the fire billow from the top of the tank.

If you've played video games, you know how the tanks work. They catch on fire, they explode. This is no different. I'm sitting here staring at this tank for what feels like is an eternity. *I can't outrun this. Do I try and huddle the tank and save my classmates? Do I scream? There's nothing I can do here. This is it. This is how I die.* At this point about three seconds had passed. I looked at the teacher who was helping a student. The student was staring at it, back at the teacher, then to me. You can't hear a thing when the machines are running. *Fuck, we're dead.* We're all frozen in fear, too afraid to move, too afraid to speak. 

Then, the teacher saw it. I've never seen someone sprint so fast. He covered the flames with his own God damn hand and disconnected the machine within a few seconds. I've seen this man do many things that could lead to injury, he is not a man to show fear. A true man's man, if you say. In this moment I did see true fear on his face. But, crisis averted. I spent the rest of the day spoked but we all moved on.

So, that's the story how I almost blew up a classroom full of students via a gas tank. *almost.*

Tl;dr: While welding, the top of a gas tank ignited due to a spark and a gas leak. Within seconds, it was put out preventing a very dangerous explosion that would have certainly caused an array of explosions with the rest of the tanks in the room, turning us into child chunk lasagna.",tifu,TIFU by almost blowing up a classroom full of children

I had just done some horizontal tango, like you do when you're almost 18.

So I'm in the car with this used condom all tied off and ready to get thrown out but I have no trashcan to throw it out in. So I stick it in the wrapper, and into my pocket.

The rest of this story was told to me by my stepfather.

One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I'm pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don't respond. Most of my friends see me and think I'm joining, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I'm stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I'm placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks!

keep in mind that my mother is eating at this restaurant, which i wasn’t aware of at the moment, and me and my friends are standing in front of it. curiosity finally got the better of me and i asked my friend nick if i could hit his vape once just to try it. now this isn’t your average juul, this is one of those vapes that blows a giant ass cloud when you exhale.

prohibitedeyes,caa1vc,"Oh boy, how do I start here. 

This happened around a week ago and today it came back in a very serious fashion. 

So let's begin with what actually happened om that day. 
I was visiting my aunt and cousin, my cousin being a year older than me. 
I heard that she had failed her exams, so I decided to talk to her and maybe comfort her, since I've been through the same pain of not being able to graduate, I knew how sad she must have been. 
We talked a bit, mostly her telling me her feelings about this and how she doesn't want to retake the exam. 
I tried my very best to cheer her up while also telling her about my experiences with retaking an exam, maybe finding some piece of information that might help her get through this. 
She managed to cheer up a little and we hugged. 
Now comes the fuck up. 
In a joking way, I grabbed her ass, wanting to make her laugh while also trying to distract her from tomorrow, as in that moment I thought that she might have needed it. 
Oh boy how I was wrong. 

She laughed it off, calling me an idiot as we continued talking like normal until later , where she told that I should never do it again and that it's not the proper way to treat a girl. 
I realized that I might have gone too far and I apologized, still thinking that she still took the thing I did lightly. 
Before leaving her house, she warned me again that guys shouldn't do that, but she smiled, making me think that she still was in a good mood. 

Fast forward a few hours ago when I suddenly get a call by my aunt, telling me that what I did was not okay and that my cousin was in a pretty bad mood. 
I did not think that it would have ended like this, so I apologized to my aunt, realizing the weight of my mistake as I went to WhatsApp to apologize yet again, this time to my cousin. 

With that, I thought maybe this topic would have been done. 
But nope, I suppose I haven't suffered enough it seems. 
Apparently my aunt told my other aunt about this and that aunt came to our house today, telling my mom about what happened, causing her to have a talk with me. 
She told me that we will talk with my cousin and aunt, wanting to clear up this topic once and for all. 

And now I am here, regretting that ass grab I did, thinking about how far the consequences might go. 
So yeah, moral of the story: Please don't be a dumbass like me and grab your cousin's ass. 


Tl;dr: I grabbed my cousin's ass, causing her to feel bad and that led to her mom and my mom to get involved in this topic.",tifu,TIFU by grabbing my cousin's ass.
kaylacactus,caa936,"Actually did just happen a couple minutes ago. 

I decided to put “kitty caps” on my kittens nails, because she’s been scratching the shit out of everyone/everything lately. (Yes clipping her nails and buying scratching posts aren’t working 100% of the time yet) I had some time to kill so I figured why not. 

My cat obviously doesn’t like having them put on her because I have to hold her still for a couple minutes at a time, so after getting a few on I decided to take a break. They do just stick on with super glue that comes with a little tube to put the glue in the caps. 

Here leads to the fuck up.. I come back maybe 15 minutes later and decide to resume. But apparently the glue had gotten stuck at the top of the applicator and hardened. I decided to keep pushing glue out and hoping that it would just pop the hard piece out, nope, it didn’t. Immediately after I decide “well I may as well bite it off” so I did, the moment I put my teeth on it the hardened glue comes out and the rest of the glue I had pushed to the top goes flowing into my mouth. I can’t just spit it out. I try to avoid touching my tongue to other parts in my mouth while I run to my bathroom and start scrubbing. 

I got like all of it off my tongue but there’s still a lot I can feel on my teeth, I tried brushing them with super hot water and just scraping the glue off but it’s not budging. Should be a fun few days while I wait for it to wear off. Now in hindsight, I should’ve just fucking cut the tip of the glue off in the first place. 

TL;DR: bit the tip of a super glue applicator, glue leaked into my mouth and now it’s stuck on my teeth and mildly uncomfortable for a few days.",tifu,TIFU by coating my mouth in super glue
getonthebusMFer,caal2f,"This happened many years ago. Names/places changed to protect the guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

I was dating a wonderful woman. She was super smart and nerdy, caring and considerate. We loved to go on hikes, visit museums, do crafts together, sip booze on the porch together, compete against each other at stupid stuff like mini golf and pool. We were best friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, she came with some baggage and that baggage was her mother. And trust me, that baggage was not carry-on. It was not going to fit in the overhead compartment. It was considerable.

&amp;#x200B;

Her mother was manipulative, narcissistic and controlling. All four of her grown-up daughters were cowed by her and rarely dared disagree, even though she ordered them around as if they were still little kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give an idea, often when mom had a meltdown, her daughters would blame each other. ""What did you say to mom to set her off? You know how she gets!"" It was never mom's fault. Mom was the immovable object. Failure to navigate the chaotic, turgid seas that ever-flowed around her were the fault of the sailor.

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly went along with the program while I was around her because she wasn't my first narcissist parent rodeo - my best childhood friend had a similarly lousy control freak of a father. It's their way or the highway, no in between.

&amp;#x200B;

The only saving grace was this middle-aged horrid shrew who had done practically everything to make herself as unappealing as possible to all other nearby human beings lived several hours away so I rarely had to deal with her awfulness. That ""several hours away"" part will come into play later.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd already clashed with Momzilla once a few months prior over something minor, but that's the thing with narcissists: nothing is ever small. Still, I figured ""that was that"", and I'd never be invited over again, but surprisingly when Thanksgiving came around, she asked me (us) over for the weekend.  I told my GF it was a bad idea, but my GF really wanted us to somehow come to terms. Again, not my first rodeo. I was extremely dubious, but reluctantly agreed. We made the four hour drive, and when we arrived it was snowing pretty good. A storm was moving in.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I would go the ""kill her with kindness route"". I went all out and offered to make the football game main course, my 7 layer dip. I prepped everything and packed it in a cooler for the trip. It's always a winner. I also brought a nice $30 bottle of wine. The weekend plan included going to Church on Sunday, and though no longer religious, I wanted to be respectful and brought a nice shirt-tie-sweater-slacks-shoes combo.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole time it was ""Yes, ma'am"" and ""Right away, Mrs. Smith""(not real name). I helped set the table, took out the trash, whatever was asked. I even said something like ""If you don't need my help anymore, I'll go watch some TV."" That's how Leave it to Beaver I took it, and she seemed to eat it up. My GF was over the moon. ""You're doing really great.""  Everything was going swimmingly as we sat down to Thanksgiving dinner, and dinner went great, too. Who knows? Maybe there was a real chance here, right?

&amp;#x200B;

But you don't come to this sub for happy endings.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course, it happened. Trivial Pursuit. Now, I'm a pretty competitive guy, I'll admit, but that wasn't the problem. I can take a beat gracefully. Her mother could not. Her older sister was no peach in the losing department either, especially losing to a MAN. Especially losing to the MAN dating her younger sister who she thought wasn't good enough for her. Especially a MAN who had the temerity to (GASP!!) disagree occasionally.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I should mention something I noticed about her older sister's husband. This was one of the most docile human beings I'd ever met. I've seen table lamps be more disagreeable than this guy. He was invisible. The only time he really even spoke is when we were out of the house and away from the mother, and then he'd open up some. But around the soul-sucking harpy of a mother, he was quiet as a mouse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we had an odd number of players and were playing in teams, he said he was tired and to play without him. That's why the oldest sister paired off with mom, which was like pairing up nitroglycerin with one of those paint shakers at the home improvement store. Any small victory during the game and these two were talking trash and high-fiving. 

&amp;#x200B;

And on a side note, how is it mom, who lived alone (divorce, big fucking surprise, I know) didn't even have so much as one friend over for Thanksgiving?

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking back, older sister's husband was the smart one. He knew the potential train wreck that was coming. He was sitting in the easy chair watching TV with his back to us. Sonofabitch probably had a grin from ear to ear. Probably had a bucket of popcorn in his lap.

&amp;#x200B;

So there I am playing Trivial Pursuit teamed with my super smart girlfriend. The mom and sister trash talk has been silenced as we go on a tear. In an hour or so, we're winning pretty handily, and up three pieces from our nearest competitor as we head for the middle hub thing. The other teams got to decide which category we played for the win, and they chose sports, which was our weakest subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question: ""Who was the only heavyweight world champion boxer to retire undefeated?"" Now as a kid who grew up in the Mike Tyson/Rocky Balboa era I couldn't NOT pick up a fair bit of boxing history through osmosis. I knew the answer. I 100% knew the answer, but as I surveyed the other teams' half-filled pieces, some nagging voice told me not to say it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I mean, I'd gone all out nice. I spent $50 on food and drink, I'd done everything she said. I bowed and scraped. Am I going to LOSE on PURPOSE to make psycho mom feel better? Fuck that. That's too far.

&amp;#x200B;

""Rocky Marciano"" I said triumphantly. We won.  But in retrospect, as the saying goes, I probably should have let the wookie win.

&amp;#x200B;

Things quietly went to shit after that. We put the game away and everyone sort of went in their separate directions, to relax with a book or get ready for bed. But the storm was coming.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I woke to the smell of breakfast. I headed downstairs and everyone was already up. Mom was cooking. Youngest sister and her boyfriend were eating left overs of my nacho dip, and saying how good it was. Mom went to serve them from the pan and she said, ""I think I'm good with nachos for now, mom."" Mom served her anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a second helping, and said over and over how good it was. It was, alas, too late. The Rube Goldberg machinery of narcissist jeolousy had been clanging, whirling and buzzing since at least the night before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in the afternoon, everyone in the house was relaxing. I was surfing on the computer when my girlfriend came and told me. ""Um...My mom's being... well, you know..."" she trailed off. ""I'm so sorry. It's so unfair. You didn't do anything wrong."" Then she said solemnly, ""She wants us to leave."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked but not shocked. I just felt sorry for my GF. And trust me, I've had my battles with my mom but nothing like this. And anyway, what the hell happened? I'd been a goddamn saint doing whatever she said. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we started getting our things together. Midway through putting our stuff near the door, her mom stops us. ""What are you doing?"" she asks. My GF replies, you said, you didn't want him to stay the weekend, so we're leaving.""

&amp;#x200B;

Mother pulled her aside and I go back upstairs to get more stuff. I hear some yelling. I take a seat and wait. A half hour later she came back to me, nearly in tears.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, mom wanted HER to STAY, and for ME to GO. How the hell was that going to happen? We only took one car. Did she seriously expect her daughter to drive me four hours home and then turn around and drive four hours back? In the middle of a weekend storm?

&amp;#x200B;

Nope. Mom said I could catch a Greyhound at the station in town. You read that right. She was kicking me out of her house and telling me to catch a fucking bus home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point, the rational amongst you are thinking ""Wait! Why didn't anyone confront the mother and tell her how unreasonable she was being?"" But remember what I said earlier? Mom doesn't move. Everyone moves around mom. That's what over two decades of conditioning results in. If I was in court against mom and her daughters were the jury, I didn't have a chance in hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Instantly I realized I was in a no-win situation. Not only that, it was factually bullshit that she hadn't invited ""us"". She brought up Church as part of the plans, which unless things have shifted around really fucking mightily since I was a practicing Catholic 15 years before, was still on Sunday. Another thing, the youngest daughter's boyfriend was staying the whole weekend. Apparently that was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

It started sinking in how truly fucked I was. But then I corrected: how fucked my GF was. Because if we both left now, she was choosing me over family. She was ruining Thanksgiving weekend. She didn't know what to do. I said, ""Fine. Honestly, I'm miserable in this house. She doesn't want me here and I don't want to be here. This whole hating me but inviting me to Thanksgiving stuff is bullshit. And honestly this whole family dynamic is pretty fucked up. I love you, but I'm sorry, I don't love your family. Put me on that fucking bus.""

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what happened. I took a bus back home, four miserable hours wondering if at any moment it would go flying off the road into a ditch. The station was on the complete ass end of town from my apartment so I had to take another hour of public trans. I got off the bus a few blocks from my place and I was literally dragging my luggage through five inches of snow at 11 PM at night. The wind was relentless. My face stung from snow and freezing. It was like a cut scene out of the first Max Payne.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I could have looked more pathetic, and it suddenly struck me as such. I stopped and looked around. I wanted to remember this moment exactly as shitty as it was. Then I had to laugh like hell at the absurdity of it. I looked up at the sky and said, ""This is why I stopped believing in you, asshole!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped off my stuff in my apartment. It was all soaked through. I walked down to the bar. It was still two hours till closing and that was plenty to get good and drunk. I ordered a double jack and coke. A friend of mine, a guy from Ireland with no family in the US said, ""So how was your Thanksgiving?"" I laughed, took a big sip and said, ""It'll make a good story someday.""

Ragnadrok,ca5yhs,"I live at home with my parents, and just a bit ago I felt like having a shower. There are few times that I can sneak my fleshlight out of my room to clean it, so the best times are when I shower. Figured I'd clean it out real quick, shower, make a sandwich, then watch a bit of Stranger Things before bed. I finished cleaning my toy and myself, dressed in the bathroom, then went out to make my sandwich, placing my used towel and dirty clothes in a chair. Halfway through making it, I heard my parent's door open, followed by the bathroom door closing.  At this moment I was just super jazzed about making my delicious sandwich and could already taste the goodness. 
My mom comes out and sits in the living room, watching some Facebook video on her phone. We talk briefly before I finish my making my sandwich, I say goodnight and head to my room. Once in, I put my sandwich on the desk and start to set up when I remember I forgot my towel and clothes, and then it hits me. The fucking fleshlight. 

When I go out to the living room, my mom is still watching whatever video. I grab my towel then head to the bathroom, hoping that I had at least been smart enough to draw the curtain closed, but of fucking course, I had not. One glance into the shower, and you see the fleshlight laying proudly on the sill of the tub in all its pink silicon glory. 

I only give myself a couple seconds to tell myself how much of a goddamned idiot I am before I grab it, wrap it in my towel, then make a show of loudly grabbing and rinsing out my shower cadey, letting the hard plastic clank quite a bit as I did so. Then I headed back to my room where I gave myself quite a bit more time to call myself an idiot. It's been about a half hour, and she hasn't come to talk to me about it, and I'm hoping she doesn't, kinda embarrassing. 
Anyway, hoping I could give y'all a bit of a laugh at me, I'm already laughing quite a bit at myself.

So my wife and I were feeling a little frisky after a rather boring day. It’s night, the lights are off, and she tells me she wants to try it. I’ll be honest, I’ve never really been one that wanted to try anal, but the moment was heated and I was horny, so sure, why not?

So we lube up, get ourselves ready, and get to it. Not going to go into details but it went alright for the first time, we took it slow. 

However, something felt off the whole time. I couldn’t quite figure out what it was, but my wife seemed to be doing ok, so I just rolled with it.

Finally, I took my dick out to finish on her stomach, and as I grabbed my dick, I felt something. Something big, that shouldn’t be there. I quickly went to turn the light on, and looked down horrified.

There was a squashed worm on my dick. My wife had pinworms. I had anal sex with pinworms.

cookielover45,caaoah,"I actually posted this in another thread but I will go into deeper details in this one.  So this happened the other day.  Me (22 M) and my best friend (22 F) have been friends ever since we were five. We were both at a party with our mutual friends just having a good time. I was talking with some other people and so was she until we both met later on a couch, just the two of us. It started out with a funny conversation, she was laughing at me for looking so sloppy because my hair was all messed up and my shirt was all wrinkled; we joked around with each other for the next 20-30 minutes. Then she looked more serious and told me she liked me. At first, I thought she was just messing with me. Our friendship and chemistry is all fun and jokes, she would make me laugh more than anyone else would and I would do the same with her. We would never seriously get mad at each other, it was pretty much a clean friendship. She is pretty much a twin sister to me; she is 12 days younger than I am, we laugh at the same things, our parents are good pals, we lived in the same neighborhood growing up, we went to the same school in the same class, she would always be at my house and I would always be at hers, and we even have like the same names (Alex and Alexis) which is probably the reason why we were such good friends all this time. There was no indication that she liked me at all throughout the 17 years I've known her and I don't know when she cooked up those feelings for me; it could have been recent or ever since our early years. When she told me that she had feelings for me I just laughed at her like how she laughed at me earlier and told her that I liked her too (even though I didn't mean it) but with a VERY sarcastic connotation; I just kept laughing like a dick right at her face. She didn't respond with any laughs at all, not a word; she got up from the couch and ran out the door to her car and that was that. Like an idiot, I didn't run after her, I just sat there thinking about what I did wrong; it was then that I realized that she didn't just see me as a best friend. It was around 12:30 AM at the time so I just waited until the morning to contact her. The next morning (yesterday), I went to her house but no one was home or she didn't want to open; I tried calling and texting her cell but she didn't pick up nor respond; I even messaged her on Instagram, nothing. As I said, she is like my twin and the thought of her being my girlfriend makes me want to throw up. But come to think of it, is she nice? Absolutely she is. Is she funny? Always. Is she smart? Top in our class. Is she pretty? YES, probably top 10 cutest things I've ever laid my eyes on. Is she my match made in heaven? Probably. 

I don't know what to do guys, right now I'm anticipating that our friendship is over and I'll probably never have a normal conversation with her ever again, I probably won't even have any conversation with her again. I still don't know if I even like her, she has the most amazing qualities but it's just the fact that we've known each other for so long that's tripping me up. Right now, I'm anticipating that my friendship with her is done and she'll never see me again. She's the best friend I've ever had. Fuck dudes.

lamullen,ca2oxv,"As per usual this didn't happen today but this past Saturday. I (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I'm pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don't respond. Most of my friends see me and think I'm joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I'm stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I'm placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks!

denob,caacpc,"This happened when I was around ten years old but I thought this would be an appropriate place to post it.

My mom is an artist, and being an artist involves submitting a portfolio of work and a cover letter to explain why you should be granted entry into 'x' art show. The cover letter usually involves a bit of history about yourself, your shows, and the inspiration behind your work. Standard stuff really. 

Anyway, one day when I was about ten years old I went on the family computer and noticed my mom's cover letter had been left open. I didn't really know what it was, but the first line was something along the lines of ""all I ever wanted to be was an artist"".

Naturally, the comedian in me decided to change the first line to ""all I ever wanted to be was a noob"". I giggled to myself, saved the document and closed it. I then proceeded to forget about it for the next several months.

My mom (unbeknownst to the change) proceeded to use that cover letter for the next several months. Months of notifying many national art shows that from the day she was born she wanted to be a noob. I'm not sure why they didn't ask her about it - maybe they thought it was art? Or that she was a character? Who knows.

After a couple of surprising rejections one newspaper editor was finally inquisitive enough to ask about that first line, and my very confused mom explained that she had no idea what a noob was or how that word got there.. She then brought it up at dinner and I recalled back to those many months ago and explained myself. Dad thought it was the funniest thing ever. Mom did not. 

The desire to be a noob lives on in all of us

englishbyname,ca8rz4,"This happened today!

The street I live on has a lot of CCTV coverage on it from various houses thanks to us being targeted by criminals a couple of years ago causing everyone to be ultra paranoid, as such the street's Facebook group is like a modern day neighbourhood watch. The past week there have been a couple of cars broken in to so everyone is extra alert at the minute.

I bought a 3D printer last week and got it set up over this weekend. After a few test prints I finally started to print my first project today, as it's due to be going for 18 hours I thought this afternoon was a good time to leave it to its own devices and go out somewhere with the family.

So the FU is that I set the house alarm when I left the house and the movement of the printer set the alarm off - I have no idea how long it was going off for but I was out for a couple of hours, so probably ruined everyone's quiet Sunday afternoon sat in the garden. One thing is for certain though, this street is extra vigilant on social media, but in real life there's nobody to be seen at a time of potential criminal activity.

Also, now my wife isn't talking to me because she feels so embarrassed.

TL;DR - New 3D printer set house alarm off in an ultra paranoid street ruining the tranquility of a summer's afternoon for all my neighbours.

MisterGamenWatch1985,c9yaj1,"This happened last week. It's just been in the back of my head trying to process that it actually happened. I'm bi and I use Grindr occasionally. The night before I get a a message from a guy (26m) asking if I (33m) wanted to come over and I declined because I had work at 6 the next day, but maybe after I was off if he was still awake I'd go by. We chat throughout the day because I'm currently looking for a FWB who's local and not a tweaker. I decided that after work I'd go and get some head. He gives me his address and when I get there I see a car in the drive way and it looks familiar but I see a ton of cars everyday that look like the one in the drive way so I shrug it off.  He lets me in and we promptly go to his room. I asked if his roommates were home because we kind of rushed to the room. Then he says oh yeah I live with my mom and asks if that's okay. I said yeah and asked if I had to be quiet or whatever and he said no so we proceed having fun. Fast forward and I'm about to have actual sex with him and on the side of the bed is a picture of him and his mom.  I got less aroused gradually. Why you ask? Because of a picture of him and his mom? No, because only a few months earlier I asked his mom my former coworker(56f) for HER NUMBER and we were actually talking about going out for drinks and possibly hooking up but it never went anywhere. NOW I'M GETTING HEAD FROM AND HAVING SEX WITH HER SON IN HER HOUSE.... WHILE SHE IS IN THE KITCHEN DOING DISHES. So, naturally I still finished. As I'm getting ready to leave I hear her voice and the guy asks if  I want discretion as I leave. THANK GOD HE ASKED THAT. As calmly as possible and faking not being uncomfortable I say please, he steps out first tells his mom to go to her room for a sec and she agrees. I left and he hit me up later saying he had a good time. I lied and said I did too.


Edit: grammar. Fixed almost all the sentences that started with ""so"" since it bothered someone and I read it over and it bothered me too.

So I'm just chilling in my bed, butt ass naked of course, and I'm like ""hey, lemme take some booty pics""

I have a long long history of body image issues (but that's a whole other story), so for me to take pictures of my body, solely for me, is a pretty big step.

So I'm taking these pics on Snapchat, saving them to 'my eyes only,' and I'm actually feeling semi confident. 

So I finish my photo sesh, get dressed, and get a snap from my best friend.

It's a reply to a post on my story... but I didn't post anything?

It reads ""did you mean to post this?"" Confused, I click on the snap...

Just for some background, I'm from the UK where it is still illegal to sell and distribute thc products of any kind for medical or recreational use. Through a friend I managed to find someone who sold thc vape liquid in England which for me was perfect! I quit smoking cigarettes mid-April after 7 years which is a massive achievement for me, but I've also been a regular weed smoker for a while to help with anxiety and sleep issues, as well as socially/recreationally as I don't like drinking alcohol and many of my friends also smoke, more so over the last couple of years but I've cut down considerably over the last few months. For many reasons which are irrelevant to this post, I was still using tobacco in spliffs when I smoke weed so when I found out I could get my hands on vape liquid as a complete tabacoo free option I was over the moon.

I placed an order on Sunday which arrived on Wednesday, which is where the story really begins...

The guy who I purchased this from said at full strength approximately 5 hits will be more than enough to get you incredibly high, but I decided to mix the juice in with a normal nicotine liquid I use so I wouldn't use too much at once since my vape is my main source of nicotine. At this new lower strength and a good understanding of my tolerance, I went in feeling confident and comfortable. And this is where I fucked up, I was just casually taking hits and not really feeling anything for a while, so I added a little more into my tank. As soon as I took one more pull on that bad boy my body ascended into heaven itself. I was easily the most high I had been in months, colours were so vivid, my ears sounded like I was under water, my body felt so heavy yet like I was floating and my brain was just mush. But this was only the beginning.

Luckily, I decided to do this in the evening when I had no plans and I was in my room at home (I live with my mum who is very anti weed) and I had told people I trusted what I was doing so they were checking up on me via messages regularly. This first few hours were fairly uneventful, I was just stoned out of my mind, completely absorbed by random YouTube videos playing on my tv and ended up falling asleep after a while. 

I woke up at 3am still off of my nut with INSANE munchies, so fast forward a few minutes and I was in the kitchen scavenging for snacks like I was a bear preparing for hibernation just stuffing whatever I could find into my mouth with 0 regret. After a successful feast, I passed the fuck back out for a couple of hours thinking I'd be fine as soon as I woke up and ready to resume working life. Safe to say, I was wrong.

I'm an apprentice, so I attend 1 day of college a week then work for 4. I was getting ready to go in to college and finish my final assignments, just using my vape as a nicotine replacement like normal. Everything felt incredible, my playlist felt especially great, absolutely belting out every single god damn song, and I left my house and started walking to the bus. That's when it hit me all over again. I reached the bus stop and it was like a tidal wave of realisation suddenly hit far too late. Turns out I had fallen asleep before all of the thc liquid had been used up so I had been slowly getting more and more high again through the morning and being a slow build up, all hit me as soon as I stepped outside into the fresh air, so there I was sat on the bus feeling like my soul had completely left my body and gone to party with Snoop Dogg himself. 

Being a heavy smoker through my teens, I use my vape quite regularly and managed to make the same mistake Every. Single. Time. Each time I was convinced I was fine and there was only nicotine left in my vape I was just slapped by the Ganja Gods themselves and went straight back into my vicious stoner cycle. Luckily, being at the end of my college term, I didn't interact too much with lecturers or anyone I'd get in trouble with if they caught on to the fact I was obviously incredibly stoned in public. This whole situation lasted right up until around lunchtime on Friday when it finally left the coil on my vape and I was thc free, so overall lasted approximately 40 hours straight. From now on, I am going to be incredibly careful when I use this stuff

tryMelDareYou,cabuxe,"This happened many years ago but I still remember it clearly.  


I was in 5th grade math class, and everyone was working on worksheets. My friend bought a UV spy pen that had invisible ink that only fluoresced under UV light. Being the dumb and immature 5th graders we were, I drew dicks all over my body, including my face, thinking I was the slickest kid out there since the teachers can't see it. We started laughing until I started getting rashes all over my body due to the chemicals in the ink.   


Guess what shape the rashes were.   


Everyone started laughing but I was panicking. ""How long were the rashes going to be on my body? How visible are they to others? What do I do?"" I did the only logical thing any 5th grader would do, I started smearing hand sanitizer all over my body. Now if you were the teacher and you were standing 2 feet away at the door, this would be a VERY odd sight to see. He started asking why on Earth am I smearing hand sanitizer all over my body and why I was in such a panic.   


Long story short, they called my parents and when they showed up, I was covered head to toe in rashes shaped like dicks.

So my wife and I were feeling a little frisky after a rather boring day. It’s night, the lights are off, and she tells me she wants to try it. I’ll be honest, I’ve never really been one that wanted to try anal, but the moment was heated and I was horny, so sure, why not?

So we lube up, get ourselves ready, and get to it. Not going to go into details but it went alright for the first time, we took it slow. 

However, something felt off the whole time. I couldn’t quite figure out what it was, but my wife seemed to be doing ok, so I just rolled with it.

Finally, I took my dick out to finish on her stomach, and as I grabbed my dick, I felt something. Something big, that shouldn’t be there. I quickly went to turn the light on, and looked down horrified.

There was a squashed worm on my dick. My wife had pinworms. I had anal sex with pinworms.

I ran straight to the toilet and puked my guts out and anal is forever ruined for me.

barelyarealperson,cacace,"This happened on the 4th but I'm fully realizing the consequences of my mistake now. 

I have a rowdy orange cat. He loves going outside and chasing bugs. Tragically, I don't like having outdoor cats (or even indoor/outdoor), and he's terminally stupid and immediately runs off as fast as he can into the neighbors fenced yards (our's isnt fenced and backs up to a retention basin) if given the chance.

On the 4th of July, he was whining at some dragonflies and birds in the yard through the screen door. I thought, well, what the hell, it's nice out, I don't work for a few more hours. I can spare 15 minutes outside with my boy. I clip a leash to his harness and head outside.

He's romping around at a contained 3 foot circle from me, swiping at bees and stuff. I try to catch a moth for him. All good fun. 

Until some fucker one street over sets off a firework (at 1PM, broad daylight). One of those loud mortar ones. My cat, thoroughly spooked, darts past me, yanking on his leash and knocking me hard on the ground.

I had had a preexising spinal problem, but it was mostly healed and i could do all my normal levels of activity. However, I didn't anticipate my ass throttling the ground at the speed of a Fast Kitty.

I laid there in the grass, vice grip on the leash, thinking about my pending death, if i deserve heaven, normal ""this is how i die"" shit. I can't get up. Can't move even a little bit without electric pain shocking my spine. I see someone in the neighbors yard laying bricks for a new deck. I tried shouting ""Sir???!"" To get help but i'm sure that dude had headphones on and assumed I was taking a pointy grass nap.

Probably ten minutes later I was able to scoop my now-bored cat up and toss him in the house before collapsing to the floor. Also a big mistake, since it then took me 5 goddamn hours before i could even sit up without horrid horrid pain.

Should I have called an ambulance? Maybe.
Could I afford that? Fuck no. I work part time as a cashier with garbo insurance.

Part time at a job I ended up calling out of. At a store that sells liquor. On the 4th of july. I owe my coworkers an edible arrangement. I think they thought I was lying so I could party instead of selling cigarettes and paper towels to drunk locals.

Anyways. It's a few days later and I still take 10 minutes to get off of couches, my bed, etc. If I take my back brace off I literally melt to the floor like a wooden push-button puppet. Thank god tomorrow's monday, my first day off since the incident, and i can go to the doctor.

He's romping around at a contained 3 foot circle from me, swiping at bees and stuff. I try to catch a moth for him. All good fun. 

Until some fucker one street over sets off a firework (at 1PM, broad daylight). One of those loud mortar ones. My cat, thoroughly spooked, darts past me, yanking on his leash and knocking me hard on the ground.

I had had a preexising spinal problem, but it was mostly healed and i could do all my normal levels of activity. However, I didn't anticipate my ass throttling the ground at the speed of a Fast Kitty.

I laid there in the grass, vice grip on the leash, thinking about my pending death, if i deserve heaven, normal ""this is how i die"" shit. I can't get up. Can't move even a little bit without electric pain shocking my spine. I see someone in the neighbors yard laying bricks for a new deck. I tried shouting ""Sir???!"" To get help but i'm sure that dude had headphones on and assumed I was taking a pointy grass nap.

Probably ten minutes later I was able to scoop my now-bored cat up and toss him in the house before collapsing to the floor. Also a big mistake, since it then took me 5 goddamn hours before i could even sit up without horrid horrid pain.

Should I have called an ambulance? Maybe.
Could I afford that? Fuck no. I work part time as a cashier with garbo insurance.

Part time at a job I ended up calling out of. At a store that sells liquor. On the 4th of july. I owe my coworkers an edible arrangement. I think they thought I was lying so I could party instead of selling cigarettes and paper towels to drunk locals.

Anyways. It's a few days later and I still take 10 minutes to get off of couches, my bed, etc. If I take my back brace off I literally melt to the floor like a wooden push-button puppet. Thank god tomorrow's monday, my first day off since the incident, and i can go to the doctor.

Tl;dr: forgot my neighbors were pyromaniacs, walked my cat, activated the sleeper cell in my spine to KO my lumbar vertebrae. Can't move without pain anymore.

So me (16m) and my best friend (16f) used to date like 2 years ago. Nothing sexual, cos we were like 14, but we broke it off end of summer 2017 and became besties after. We talk constantly, on messenger and suchlike. You know the usual stuff. 

So i finished revising for the day to check facebook, and notice that she had sent a photo on a group chat. Nothing Unusual, she usually sends harry potter memes to look at. so i open it to look at what seemed to be a pair of boobs. 

Ok. 

Thats a development.

Intelligentia295,cacl4q,"Last year when I was applying for colleges I had to fill out multiple parent/guardian information forms and I used Chrome's auto-fill to reduce the tedious work.

Last night I tried to sign up for a porn site and used Chrome auto-fill without checking carefully. It turned out that it filled in my father's email address instead of mine (Our address only differs by the numbers at the end). 

This morning he asked me about the confirmation message he received in front of my mother and I kind of freaked out (My family is kind of conservative, so I would never want any of my family members to know what I often watch in midnights).

I stayed calm and told him that his email might have been pawned and opened [Have I been Pawned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to check. It turned out that his email WAS pawned. I helped him changed the password and told him not to sign into suspicious sites.

Ragnadrok,ca5yhs,"I live at home with my parents, and just a bit ago I felt like having a shower. There are few times that I can sneak my fleshlight out of my room to clean it, so the best times are when I shower. Figured I'd clean it out real quick, shower, make a sandwich, then watch a bit of Stranger Things before bed. I finished cleaning my toy and myself, dressed in the bathroom, then went out to make my sandwich, placing my used towel and dirty clothes in a chair. Halfway through making it, I heard my parent's door open, followed by the bathroom door closing.  At this moment I was just super jazzed about making my delicious sandwich and could already taste the goodness. 
My mom comes out and sits in the living room, watching some Facebook video on her phone. We talk briefly before I finish my making my sandwich, I say goodnight and head to my room. Once in, I put my sandwich on the desk and start to set up when I remember I forgot my towel and clothes, and then it hits me. The fucking fleshlight. 

When I go out to the living room, my mom is still watching whatever video. I grab my towel then head to the bathroom, hoping that I had at least been smart enough to draw the curtain closed, but of fucking course, I had not. One glance into the shower, and you see the fleshlight laying proudly on the sill of the tub in all its pink silicon glory. 

I only give myself a couple seconds to tell myself how much of a goddamned idiot I am before I grab it, wrap it in my towel, then make a show of loudly grabbing and rinsing out my shower cadey, letting the hard plastic clank quite a bit as I did so. Then I headed back to my room where I gave myself quite a bit more time to call myself an idiot. It's been about a half hour, and she hasn't come to talk to me about it, and I'm hoping she doesn't, kinda embarrassing. 
Anyway, hoping I could give y'all a bit of a laugh at me, I'm already laughing quite a bit at myself.
TL;DR left my fleshlight in super plain sight in the shower, more than likely got spotted, looking forward to a future talk!

UPDATE: My mom has yet to look me in the eyes, and my stepdad laughed when he first saw me today, so that's neat. If she doesn't talk to me today, she's not gonna bring it up, and probably take a long while to loon me in the eyes again.",tifu,TIFU by leaving my fleshlight in the shower.
iatesquirtle,cacnvw,"This happened a few months ago, and I graduated high school in 2018 so i haven’t been a student in a bit. 

So I love chipotle, and I’m a broke college kid so I usually take any opportunity to sign up for a coupon. The coupon I thought I was signing up for was a buy one get one free coupon from their “reading rewards program”. I assumed I had to be a high school student to qualify, so I lied a little bit on the form, and I was required to give the high schools address. Didn’t think anything of it, I’m desperate for a burrito. 


Fast forward a few weeks later I get an email saying I qualify for the reading rewards, I’m psyched and immediately scan the email looking for the coupon. 

But there is no coupon in the email. Instead, they mailed coupons for all of the students TO THE HIGH SCHOOL and ADDRESSED IN MY NAME. It turns out what I signed up for was an incentive program to get students to read, with this BOGO coupon as a reward. Hence the title “reading rewards program” and why you had to be affiliated with a school or library to sign up. 

This is not what I had planned and I don’t really know what to do because I can track the package and in a few days they’re going to receive a big ass box of chipotle coupons that was intended for me. I emailed the school librarian who I somewhat knew from my days there and explained the situation and she was cool with it. But I never got my free burrito

jendestiny114,cadxm6,"So this just happened 20 minutes ago and to be honest I’m still not sure if I’m okay so any doctors out there that might read this, lemme know!

So, every summer I usually do a Nair hair removal on my body, from like upper stomach to mid thigh. I’ve been doing it for a few years to achieve that smooth as a baby dolphin skin, so i know my skin is not sensitive or allergic to this product. 

Now, the Nair I buy comes with this [little white sponge.](https://imgur.com/a/juqaAMx) This helps basically “wash the hair away” by rubbing it off. I typically wash mine after every use. 

I recently went on a lake trip and I did my whole regime before I left. When I came back (as I was gone for quite some time) I noticed I missed a few spots and plus it was going to be date night soon so I figured *what the hell, I’ll do a bit more*

I was putting away my laundry after I came home, and found my sponge mixed in with my clothes. I set it aside, grabbed my clothes and lathered up with Nair. I waited my standard 5 or so minutes and hopped in the shower. Grabbed my sponge, and started rubbing. 

*oh my god*. At first, nothing was amiss. I’m rubbing, and the hair is coming off (in pretty good chunks but hey the product is working!). As I finish my front, I start to move to my backside. My literal backside. 

And then, it feels like I’m on fire. I go to wipe over a spot I already did and almost fall to my knees in pain. By now, I’ve almost finished my entire backside; back, lower butt and all. And it feels like my skin is eating itself. 

Let’s pause here and take a trip down my own TIFU memory lane. About 10 years ago, I was young and had a sick birthday party with awesome temporary tattoos that I put everywhere. I had forgotten about them until it was time to go to school Monday morning, and in a *holy shit everyone is going to make fun of me for having a pirate temporary tattoo on my cheek* induced moment, I grabbed the Mr.Clean Magic Eraser from under our kitchen sink and scrubbed my face as vigorously as possible. 

Now for those who don’t know what a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is, lets just say it’s a small white sponge that packs the power of all the Greek Gods in it to remove any stain on any surface. I thought it would be a great move to scrub my skin with it, and boy was I wrong. The skin around my cheek melted off in some sort of disgusting science experiment and scabbed, leaving everyone to call me “zombie girl” for weeks. Safe to say, I am traumatized and know *exactly* what that sensation feels like. 

Okay, back to the present. So here I am, skin burning and glaring red. I finish my shower, change into the loosest clothes I own, and lay down to cry. As I’m in bed, my grandfather comes over and says “hey, I cleaned the bathroom and threw my magic erasers in with your laundry. Did you find them when you put away your clothes?” 

And that my friends, is the moment I had a flashback of my zombie face trauma, and knew I had made the biggest FU of my life, twice

And of course, here’s the [proof on my body. ](https://imgur.com/a/T0zSFdF)

ImNotThaaatDrunk,cae468,"So there I was, spending my morning mowing the lawn on this gorgeous early July day. Not how I wanted to kick off the last day of the weekend, but proper care of the homestead is essential in my book. I was back behind the geraniums when the mower coughed out a huge cloud of dirt. I immediately stopped because the last time this happened I got a softball sized chunk of wet soil wedged up against the blade which seized up the motor. I figured this was what was happening again as my wife regularly tends the geraniums and in doing so turns up several large dirt chunks.

 I turned the mower on its side and grabbed a stick to unwedge the clod from the blade as I'm sure you know sticking your hands in a lawnmower is a pretty far shot from a smart idea. Only there's no dirt clod. Now I'm intrigued. I knelt down to get a better look under the mower and try to piece together what caused the expulsion of of that dirt. As my dumb ass was kneeling on all fours looking for a clue it began to dawn on me that the ground I'm on was, as C3PO once said, not entirely stable. It looked like a layer of dirt is twitching or something freaky and I was either too stupid to figure out why or my sunglasses just had too much sweat on them to see clearly. Well let me tell you, my skin was able to figure it out well before my brain.

 The moving twitching dirt that I was kneeling on was a very large colony of Mother Fucking Fire Ants! And I had just run over the main hill with the mower kicking up alllllll the lose dirt at the entrance. These little bastards were out in full force looking for the reason why their grand entrance hall was missing, only to find his big goofy ass kneeling over it. They got me. They got me good. Fast little shits, running up my arms, covering my legs, and yes, unfortunately going up the legs of my shorts. I never fully appreciated the name Fire Ant before, but ooooooh boy let me tell you.

The neighbors got a great show of me screaming explitives and hopping around like a lunatic, slapping at my arms and legs and trying to pull my pants down in the beautiful midmorning sun. My wife thought I mowed over a power line and was being hilariously electrocuted. It quite literally felt like a hundred burning match heads were being pressed into my flesh. A few of them got trapped in my socks and went ham on my ankles. And proceeded to keep going ham until I took my shoes and socks off and dove into the shower, with no post mowing shower beer, to whimper like a little girl.

Fuck you fire ants, you may have won this round but Raid goes on sale this week.

itstinyrick86,cae9qy,"This happened a while ago but I'm reminded of this almost every single day. Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.

When I was 18 I was dating a girl, and we liked to have sex quite a bit. We were in a new relationship, and we were young. Most of the time we would go at it when her mom and brother were at work, because no one would be home.

One day, I had a day off of work and decided to text her to see what she was up to. She had to work for only an hour or two and her brother and Mom were gone for the whole day. HELL YEAH. It was go time.

My car was in the shop so I had her pick me up from my place. She dropped me off at her house and she went to work. As time went by, I got really bored so I decided ""Hey, itstinyrick86. You should shave your entire crotch."" And so, I decided to go look for a razor.

I looked through the entire house and couldn't find one razor. But when I checked one of the bathrooms I found a bottle of Nair Extra Strength. I've heard about it before, and knew it roved hair razor free. So I got naked and started the shower.

When I put the Nair on, I covered everything and I mean everything from the taint to the belt line. I have no shame. About 3 minutes in it started to burn but I ignored it and waited for 10 minutes for maximum effect.

Now, to get it off, you have to use soap and water. I started to wash up and I'm glad no one was home, because I let out a scream I have never heard come from me. Just the worst pain. I immediately went to Google and asked what the effects of Nair on genitals were. That's when I found out how stupid I was, and how it says on the bottle to not do that.

But I didn't stop there. I ended up still having sex with my girlfriend. We used a fire and ice condom, and that shit hurt even more than the soap and water. After I explained to her what happened, she decided to drive me to the Urgent Care facility and I was seen by a doctor who told me, and I quote.

""That has to be the dumbest thing I have seen in all my years of being a doctor.""

So all is said and done. He writes me for a prescription chemical burn ointment, and sends me on my way. I highly suggest no one ever does this. However, at least I haven't had to shave for a few years now.

Bigsam411,cadzx3,"Now I am not exactly happy right now and neither is my Fiance (or I suppose wife) but here's the story.


I am born and raised into a Muslim family. I have never been super religious though and over the past several years have started skewing more agnostic. I however value a relationship with my parents and do not want to ruin it. 

Two years ago I met someone online in one of those dating apps. She is not Muslim. We hit it off over several months and started a good relationship. 

Now the situation I was in was that I was living in a condo and wanted to get a house. My GF (at the time) lived about an hour away. Her work was closer to my area so we decided we would eventually move in together and I would get us a house. She would be essentially a tenant and pay me rent but we would be living together.

Well my parents did not like that idea and my sister was refusing to meet her because she didn't want her kids to know I was dating and not married. My dad suggested a small ceremony and we get engaged and then we could life together.

Well fast forward several months later we agreed to have it as an engagement ceremony. I got her an engagement ring, then I bought a house, and then she agreed and we scheduled this event at the house with her family and mine. Now I know this whole thing is a religious wedding but I know people who have done it as an engagement and then had their wedding at another time. This got explained to my fiance early on but maybe she didn't hear the religious marriage part or forgot I said it.

Well today we had the ceremony. My side of the family (even though I made it super clear) treated it like a wedding. Her side of the family was blindsided and her dad basically had to give her away and we signed paperwork. I previously explained how this means nothing to the government and we can still get married on our own terms but now she is super upset, I am super upset and everyone who was at the event (on both sides) is super happy.

Tldr: I just accidentally got married because i didn't try hard enough to set boundaries with my parents. Now I am super upset.",tifu,Tifu by accidentally getting married
IamcatMeowMeow,caeejc,"So yes, this wasn't today, but was about 3 weeks ago. After coming to terms with the missed opportunity I thought some of you here might get a kick out of the story. Here we go.

I travel a lot for work. Not just day trips, overnights, which means lots of hotels. I've often thought about hooking up when I'm staying in one, but I'm very socially awkward so I'm not good at flirting or one night stands kinda thing. My friends say I am good looking (the honest types who would call you a pig if you weren't) but I don't have the confidence.

Anyway. On one of these trips I'd finished work for the day and was down at the hotel bar, surprisingly not that busy as was in a big city as opposed to a rural trip. After a while I notice a hot woman walk in. I find myself staring at her more than I should to a total stranger, but then I realise why. She's a porn star I recognise. And one I very frequently...watch. I wasn't certain from the face but could tell by the distinctive tattoos.

She's alone and gets a drink, and I guess I must have still been staring even though I tried not to, as we made eye contact. I went to look away but she smiled, so I smiled back, and to my shock she walked over. I won't bore you with the details of the whole conversation, but it went really well. We made initial small talk about inconvenient parking outside and then moved on to actually chatting. She told me her name (her real one) and told me about her dogs, leaning over showing me pictures, her hand on my shoulder, stuff like that. More shockingly, I didn't ruin the conversation. I didn't inappropriately mention I recognised her and actually made her laugh quite a bit, it was going really good.

So after about an hour and a half she starts motioning to get up, getting her bags together, and says she should head up to her room soon. I say ok. She says her room would be more comfortable than the bar to unwind in, I laugh and say yeah probably. She still doesn't leave yet, but after a while stands up, twirling the room key swipe card on her finger (147, still remember it) and says ""This has been fun, hopefully I'll see you again, soon"" to which I respond...

""Yes nice meeting you too, goodnight!"" Then go back to my beer, feeling ever so pleased with myself for totally having an good conversation. She pauses, then heads off.

It wasn't until I told friends about it a week or so later they pointed out that, she was actually most likely flirting with me and the twiddling the room key while standing waiting for me may well have been an invitation to join her. Being a social retard, I had no idea and just assumed she was tired.

Leftmostbus200218,caedbt,"So this happened a couple days ago, but I figured I might as well post it here now. 

So this happens while I was in the shower after a pretty long day, so my brain probably wasn’t functioning at its highest point that evening. Anyways, I was washing my hair when I looked up at the ceiling and saw a HUGE spider just crawling along like he owned the place.

Now, I don’t know about most people, but I HATE spiders, so I decide to smoosh it as quickly as possible before it runs away to bite me in my sleep later.

What I decided to do, however, was not the greatest plan. See, I’m about 5’5, and my ceiling is a lot higher than arms reach for me. So what I decided to do, was stand on the edge of my bathtub, holding on to my shower curtain, and smush it with the bottom of my shampoo bottle.

Now, the problem with this idea, however, was that I was covered in nice soapy water, and the edge of my bathtub I chose to stand on was made of slippery, porcelain, which is especially slidey when wet.

So as I’m grabbing onto my shower curtain, standing on my tip-toes on the edge of my bathtub furiously attempting to kill the spider with the bottom of the shampoo bottle against the ceiling, I slipped, taking my shower curtain with me and hitting my head on my towel rack on my way down.

And the floors of course, as most bathrooms are, nice hard tile. ‘‘Twas not a graceful nor painless landing. 

Luckily, I didn’t break any bones or concuss myself, but I do have quite a few bruises and a rouge spider that got away while I was lying on the bathroom floor contemplating my life choices.

Let’s pause here and take a trip down my own TIFU memory lane. About 10 years ago, I was young and had a sick birthday party with awesome temporary tattoos that I put everywhere. I had forgotten about them until it was time to go to school Monday morning, and in a *holy shit everyone is going to make fun of me for having a pirate temporary tattoo on my cheek* induced moment, I grabbed the Mr.Clean Magic Eraser from under our kitchen sink and scrubbed my face as vigorously as possible. 

Now for those who don’t know what a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is, lets just say it’s a small white sponge that packs the power of all the Greek Gods in it to remove any stain on any surface. I thought it would be a great move to scrub my skin with it, and boy was I wrong. The skin around my cheek melted off in some sort of disgusting science experiment and scabbed, leaving everyone to call me “zombie girl” for weeks. Safe to say, I am traumatized and know *exactly* what that sensation feels like. 

Okay, back to the present. So here I am, skin burning and glaring red. I finish my shower, change into the loosest clothes I own, and lay down to cry. As I’m in bed, my grandfather comes over and says “hey, I cleaned the bathroom and threw my magic erasers in with your laundry. Did you find them when you put away your clothes?” 

And that my friends, is the moment I had a flashback of my zombie face trauma, and knew I had made the biggest FU of my life, twice

And of course, here’s the [proof on my body. ](https://imgur.com/a/T0zSFdF)

TLDR; Used a magic eraser to take off my hair removing product. Gave myself ptsd as I have done this before, and now I have chemical burns all over my body.

EDIT: Yes I am a female and yes females grow hair everywhere on their body, believe it or not!! I am also not a fan so hence me trying to remove it. Let’s move on people. Much thanks to everyone who gave me healing suggestions! And hearts out to the people who have experienced similar situations :)

EDIT 2: sorry y’all, TIL there is not chemicals in Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, I genuinely though there was. What I am describing is a case of rubbing my skin raw mixed in with Nair, which is definitely a chemical. So my apologies.",tifu,TIFU by trying to remove my body hair
boo23boo,cajlgz,"it happened this weekend, not today, but my hangover and shame is still raging strong.

I was camping with my SO and our kid. On a small campsite where a few of their friends from school were also camping this weekend. Kids had a great time, adults started drinking early and everyone had fun. By the time all the adults had finished drinking round the camp fire, it was about 3am. I was steaming drunk. My SO was a bit tipsy but not too bad at all. 

I decided that sex in the shower was a great idea. No one in the world has ever successfully had sex in the shower without getting injured (except athletes and porn starts, and I’m not either), but in my stupid drunken horniness I forgot all past attempts and injuries, decided we should go for it. SO being a man, eagerly agreed.

So we grab some towels and head in to the shower block for some super hot fun. It has 2 showers and 2 toilets, it’s a very small campsite. After getting all wet and soapy my SO starts to do his thing, but keeps bashing his butt on the shower door, there’s just no fucking space in this tiny thing. So we head out doors. Im a fucking genius, I thought. Towel on the grass, nothing but moonlight, stars and the nearest tent about 50 meters away. Perfect.

We’re going for it then suddenly I heard a zip open, someone was getting out of their tent. Fuck fuck fuck! It was a mom from school, who I kind of know to say hello to, but not a friend as such. My SO immediate jumps up and stands up against the shower block building, where the shadows and angle she is walking from is hiding him. Leaving me on the grass in the field completely naked and steaming drunk. I tried to stand up and run to where he was, but fell backwards. Landed on my butt, really hard. Tried again, same result, except I was now sprawled in my back, completely naked and in full view of the mom. All by my fucking self. She definitely saw me.

While she was using the toilet, I managed to stand and hide with SO, who was stood there just finishing himself off. Selfish bastard! When she had gone back to her tent, I wanted to try again in the shower but SO was done and I was left very drunk, frustrated, bruised, and showering alone. 

The next morning, I could hardly move for the pain in my butt. I’ve got bruises that resemble a night spent in an S&amp;M club taking a major spanking. The school mom doesn’t make eye contact, her kid doesn’t play with mine and my hangover is so bad that death feels like a viable alternative.

TearingAtTheSeams,caf25c,"This (unfortunately) happened today...

So last night, I headed over to my boyfriend’s place with the intent of having some fun. While he was in the shower, I dressed up in a lace teddy (think a one-piece swimsuit) and fishnet thigh-highs. After our fun, we went to bed without cleaning up since we had to be up early so I could drive him to the airport. We woke up late, so before we left, I grabbed my outfit to take home to wash.

I’m sure you can see where this is going.

To my luck, everyone was out by mid-morning, so I washed my teddy and stockings, hung them up to dry in my room, and closed the door. This is enough for my family to know not to go into my room, and I was home all day, so if they needed me, they could come to me, right?

My mom had found a medical history booklet for my cat who had to be put down several years ago. Upon finding this booklet, she felt the urge that I must have it, and immediately went to my room to put it on my bed. Upon opening the door, she was greeted with my lace teddy in its cupless, crotchless, and assless glory hanging from ceiling fan, with the fishnets right behind it.

She walked all the way in my room, past the hanging lingerie, and put the booklet on my night table.

tl/dr: Wore sexy lingerie for my boyfriend. Washed it and hung it to dry in my room. Mom opened the door and saw more than either of us ever wanted her to see.

Edit: she came back for something. Before leaving, she drove the knife in deeper by saying “good for you! I’d never be able to wear something like that.”",tifu,TIFU by wearing lingerie for my boyfriend
AreYouJustKiddingMe,cammiq,"God help your souls because I'm a terrible writer... This happened last night at bedtime. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you've got me, my wife, and our two girls (8 &amp; 3). It's getting late in the AreYouJustKiddingMe household, and bath time just wrapped up. My wife sends our two girls to finish drying themselves off and get some pj's on. Now these sweet innocent little girls have recently been enjoying my eldest's new amazon echo for kid's. We got her the new kid's echo for her birthday recently and have had our earholes ~~cursed~~ blessed with the never ending sounds of their favorite songs: Old Town Road &amp; This Old Man. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've sat down with my oldest and we explored all the cool little features that come with the kid's echo. She even went so far as to write down a list of nearly ALL the commands that her echo can do... While the girls and I have been fearlessly trying to reach the farthest depths of what this echo can do; my wife realized it might be best to set up some parental controls for it, smart woman. This is where my FU began. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said that it was late. It was much later than my daughter's echo cut-off time. My little angels love getting a story before they lay their heads down to have their sweet little dreams. Well the echo reads kid's bedtime stories, sometimes in character, that my angels enjoy because, ya know, it's new and exciting. They ask if Alexa can tell them a story for bed and I tell em to go right ahead. I let them have their storytime while I go to relax with my wife and destroy some levels of 'Bricks and Balls.' My oldest runs over to me before I make it to my wife and tells me that Alexa is in sleep mode... Of course, it's past her cut-off. I hop on my phone and save the day. I turn off the 'FreeTime' on her echo that essentially designates it being in kids mode. I tell her she's all good to go and I kick back and relax.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are hanging out in her office when my oldest comes back in about 5 minutes later and tells me ""Dad, the Alexa is speaking in Spanish??"" Well even though I may be half Español, unfortunately, my fluency is equivalent to amount of melanin I hold. Regardless, I get back on the Alexa app thinking that maybe I switched the language when I turned off the other setting and give her another thumbs up. 

&amp;#x200B;

My oldest comes back in later telling me that she really doesn't like the book but she doesn't know how to change it... Are you just kidding me? So I hop up and head over to her room with her asking what book she selected; she tells me she doesn't know and that it just started reading it, weird. When we get to her room, all is silent... creepily silent. I tell Alexa to 'read me a story' and she awakens. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Continuing the last book you purchased (come on child, why're you out here buying books on your echo) '23 minutes in Hell: One man's story about what he saw, heard, and felt in that place of torment'."" DAMMIT.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that was last book I read through kindle about 3 years ago. A buddy of mine gifted it to me when we lived in Italy. I don't really read on my phone, minus reddit. I'm assuming that Spanish that they were hearing was Latin... I feel like I may need to consult a priest on how to move forward now.

jadehrley,cagag4,"so in december, my fiancé and i moved into our first apartment. nothing special, just a one-bedroom above a shop downtown. during the process of moving in, we noticed something was wrong with our dishwasher. at first, it just wouldn't latch properly when it closed, so we wrote it off as ""oh, the dishwasher doesn't close, we'll ask our landlord to fix it"". 

cue the next few months going by, where i avoid asking the landlord to come fix it because i am constantly ashamed of how messy the apartment is. it's always too full of boxes, dishes, etc... i just kept making excuses to not get that dishwasher fixed. eventually, i got used to washing dishes by hand and forgot about it. 

 april comes along, and we pick up one of our friends from an abusive situation and let them couchsurf at our place until they can get on their feet. however, they are suspicious of our dishwasher and take a crack at fixing it themselves. 

 turns out, the dishwasher door works just fine - the dishwasher was just pulled a little too far out before, so when you push it in, it closes just fine. however, the dishwasher still doesnt turn on. we checked under the sink, its hooked up to the sink just fine. we look up the owners manual for the model of the dishwasher, but the model is literally too old and the company doesn't give a shit about posting the manual up online anymore. can't find it in any online forums, either. we fiddle around with it a little bit more and give up.

 whats important about this is that on the front of the dishwasher is a dial with different ""settings""
for different types of washes. i accidentally left the dishwasher on the ""rinse"" setting, because i assumed it just didn't work and would never work.
 
turns out, there's been a light switch on our wall above one of the counters in our kitchen, and it's connected to an outlet. we never really questioned what the light switch controlled, we all sort of.. collectively assumed it controlled the outlet and left it at that. 

i went into the kitchen with my phone charger and went to plug it into the wall outlet and my knuckles brushed against the switch and turned it on. i heard this deep, mechanic gargling sound. i froze. i turned around. i realized the sound is coming from the dishwasher. my friend/roommate came running over and asked, ""what's going on? what is that?"" and then realized the sound is coming from the dishwasher. i leaned back over and flipped the switch again. the dishwasher promptly stopped gargling. we locked eyes and promptly lost our shit. our guest was very confused as to what we were yelling hysterically about.

i cannot believe that the fucking dishwasher was arbitrarily connected to a random ass light switch on my wall. i'm fucking stupid and i'm never going to get my bachelor's much less a phd. i should've been held back in fifth grade. my mom was right about me

insane_playzYT,calpg5,"This happened like 2 hours ago

So I was just lying in bed, being the horny teenager I am and I thought about something: shaving my pubic hair. So I thought, hmm, what could go wrong, fuck it, and I went into the bathroom. At this stage it was 10pm my time btw. So I look into the mirror, and find a new razor in the bathroom. I didn't want to use an actual shaver because I don't know how to really use one, and it makes noise.

&amp;#x200B;

So I wet the razor and start razoring away. And then when I am almost done, I feel this extraordinary pain. I look down, and there is blood dripping down the base of my dick and onto my balls. It looked worse than it was, as my dick was wet, blood dripped down quicker. So I start panicing, looking for toilet paper. I find some and start wiping the blood away. I get some water from the the tap and pour it over my groin. It just makes it worse. I am trying not to make sound, luckily the bathroom is at the end of house away from the bedrooms.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am wiping up blood around my dick, blood still pouring out, I had an idea. I would put a heap of toilet paper under my undies and just keep it like that for the night. The band aids were outside in the shed, and I didn't want to get them, so I stuck with my plan. And it kind of worked. Sort of. The blood still poured out. So there was blood pouring out of me and here I am trying to clean it up, I am a mess from the waist down, I give up. I sit down on a stool in the bathroom and just give up. The flow of blood has almost completely stopped by this point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing this from my bed. I have toilet paper underneath my jocks to get any excess blood that may drip out during the night. I will put a bandaid on it tomorrow.

getonthebusMFer,caal2f,"This happened many years ago. Names/places changed to protect the guilty. Long post warning.

&amp;#x200B;

I was dating a wonderful woman. She was super smart and nerdy, caring and considerate. We loved to go on hikes, visit museums, do crafts together, sip booze on the porch together, compete against each other at stupid stuff like mini golf and pool. We were best friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, she came with some baggage and that baggage was her mother. And trust me, that baggage was not carry-on. It was not going to fit in the overhead compartment. It was considerable.

&amp;#x200B;

Her mother was manipulative, narcissistic and controlling. All four of her grown-up daughters were cowed by her and rarely dared disagree, even though she ordered them around as if they were still little kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give an idea, often when mom had a meltdown, her daughters would blame each other. ""What did you say to mom to set her off? You know how she gets!"" It was never mom's fault. Mom was the immovable object. Failure to navigate the chaotic, turgid seas that ever-flowed around her were the fault of the sailor.

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly went along with the program while I was around her because she wasn't my first narcissist parent rodeo - my best childhood friend had a similarly lousy control freak of a father. It's their way or the highway, no in between.

&amp;#x200B;

The only saving grace was this middle-aged horrid shrew who had done practically everything to make herself as unappealing as possible to all other nearby human beings lived several hours away so I rarely had to deal with her awfulness. That ""several hours away"" part will come into play later.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd already clashed with Momzilla once a few months prior over something minor, but that's the thing with narcissists: nothing is ever small. Still, I figured ""that was that"", and I'd never be invited over again, but surprisingly when Thanksgiving came around, she asked me (us) over for the weekend.  I told my GF it was a bad idea, but my GF really wanted us to somehow come to terms. Again, not my first rodeo. I was extremely dubious, but reluctantly agreed. We made the four hour drive, and when we arrived it was snowing pretty good. A storm was moving in.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I would go the ""kill her with kindness route"". I went all out and offered to make the football game main course, my 7 layer dip. I prepped everything and packed it in a cooler for the trip. It's always a winner. I also brought a nice $30 bottle of wine. The weekend plan included going to Church on Sunday, and though no longer religious, I wanted to be respectful and brought a nice shirt-tie-sweater-slacks-shoes combo.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole time it was ""Yes, ma'am"" and ""Right away, Mrs. Smith""(not real name). I helped set the table, took out the trash, whatever was asked. I even said something like ""If you don't need my help anymore, I'll go watch some TV."" That's how Leave it to Beaver I took it, and she seemed to eat it up. My GF was over the moon. ""You're doing really great.""  Everything was going swimmingly as we sat down to Thanksgiving dinner, and dinner went great, too. Who knows? Maybe there was a real chance here, right?

&amp;#x200B;

But you don't come to this sub for happy endings.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course, it happened. Trivial Pursuit. Now, I'm a pretty competitive guy, I'll admit, but that wasn't the problem. I can take a beat gracefully. Her mother could not. Her older sister was no peach in the losing department either, especially losing to a MAN. Especially losing to the MAN dating her younger sister who she thought wasn't good enough for her. Especially a MAN who had the temerity to (GASP!!) disagree occasionally.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I should mention something I noticed about her older sister's husband. This was one of the most docile human beings I'd ever met. I've seen table lamps be more disagreeable than this guy. He was invisible. The only time he really even spoke is when we were out of the house and away from the mother, and then he'd open up some. But around the soul-sucking harpy of a mother, he was quiet as a mouse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we had an odd number of players and were playing in teams, he said he was tired and to play without him. That's why the oldest sister paired off with mom, which was like pairing up nitroglycerin with one of those paint shakers at the home improvement store. Any small victory during the game and these two were talking trash and high-fiving. 

&amp;#x200B;

And on a side note, how is it mom, who lived alone (divorce, big fucking surprise, I know) didn't even have so much as one friend over for Thanksgiving?

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking back, older sister's husband was the smart one. He knew the potential train wreck that was coming. He was sitting in the easy chair watching TV with his back to us. Sonofabitch probably had a grin from ear to ear. Probably had a bucket of popcorn in his lap.

&amp;#x200B;

So there I am playing Trivial Pursuit teamed with my super smart girlfriend. The mom and sister trash talk has been silenced as we go on a tear. In an hour or so, we're winning pretty handily, and up three pieces from our nearest competitor as we head for the middle hub thing. The other teams got to decide which category we played for the win, and they chose sports, which was our weakest subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question: ""Who was the only heavyweight world champion boxer to retire undefeated?"" Now as a kid who grew up in the Mike Tyson/Rocky Balboa era I couldn't NOT pick up a fair bit of boxing history through osmosis. I knew the answer. I 100% knew the answer, but as I surveyed the other teams' half-filled pieces, some nagging voice told me not to say it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I mean, I'd gone all out nice. I spent $50 on food and drink, I'd done everything she said. I bowed and scraped. Am I going to LOSE on PURPOSE to make psycho mom feel better? Fuck that. That's too far.

&amp;#x200B;

""Rocky Marciano"" I said triumphantly. We won.  But in retrospect, as the saying goes, I probably should have let the wookie win.

&amp;#x200B;

Things quietly went to shit after that. We put the game away and everyone sort of went in their separate directions, to relax with a book or get ready for bed. But the storm was coming.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I woke to the smell of breakfast. I headed downstairs and everyone was already up. Mom was cooking. Youngest sister and her boyfriend were eating left overs of my nacho dip, and saying how good it was. Mom went to serve them from the pan and she said, ""I think I'm good with nachos for now, mom."" Mom served her anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a second helping, and said over and over how good it was. It was, alas, too late. The Rube Goldberg machinery of narcissist jeolousy had been clanging, whirling and buzzing since at least the night before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in the afternoon, everyone in the house was relaxing. I was surfing on the computer when my girlfriend came and told me. ""Um...My mom's being... well, you know..."" she trailed off. ""I'm so sorry. It's so unfair. You didn't do anything wrong."" Then she said solemnly, ""She wants us to leave."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked but not shocked. I just felt sorry for my GF. And trust me, I've had my battles with my mom but nothing like this. And anyway, what the hell happened? I'd been a goddamn saint doing whatever she said. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we started getting our things together. Midway through putting our stuff near the door, her mom stops us. ""What are you doing?"" she asks. My GF replies, ""You said you didn't want him to stay the weekend, so we're leaving.""

&amp;#x200B;

Mother pulled her aside and I go back upstairs to get more stuff. I hear some yelling. I take a seat and wait. A half hour later she came back to me, nearly in tears.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, mom wanted HER to STAY, and for ME to GO. How the hell was that going to happen? We only took one car. Did she seriously expect her daughter to drive me four hours home and then turn around and drive four hours back? In the middle of a weekend storm?

&amp;#x200B;

Nope. Mom said I could catch a Greyhound at the station in town. You read that right. She was kicking me out of her house and telling me to catch a fucking bus home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point, the rational amongst you are thinking ""Wait! Why didn't anyone confront the mother and tell her how unreasonable she was being?"" But remember what I said earlier? Mom doesn't move. Everyone moves around mom. That's what over two decades of conditioning results in. If I was in court against mom and her daughters were the jury, I didn't have a chance in hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Instantly I realized I was in a no-win situation. Not only that, it was factually bullshit that she hadn't invited ""us"". She brought up Church as part of the plans, which unless things have shifted around really fucking mightily since I was a practicing Catholic 15 years before, was still on Sunday. Another thing, the youngest daughter's boyfriend was staying the whole weekend. Apparently that was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

It started sinking in how truly fucked I was. But then I corrected: how fucked my GF was. Because if we both left now, she was choosing me over family. She was ruining Thanksgiving weekend. She didn't know what to do. I said, ""Fine. Honestly, I'm miserable in this house. She doesn't want me here and I don't want to be here. This whole hating me but inviting me to Thanksgiving stuff is bullshit. And honestly this whole family dynamic is pretty fucked up. I love you, but I'm sorry, I don't love your family. Put me on that fucking bus.""

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what happened. I took a bus back home, four miserable hours wondering if at any moment it would go flying off the road into a ditch. The station was on the complete ass end of town from my apartment so I had to take another hour of public trans. I got off the bus a few blocks from my place and I was literally dragging my luggage through five inches of snow at 11 PM at night. The wind was relentless. My face stung from snow and freezing. It was like a cut scene out of the first Max Payne.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I could have looked more pathetic, and it suddenly struck me as such. I stopped and looked around. I wanted to remember this moment exactly as shitty as it was. Then I had to laugh like hell at the absurdity of it. I looked up at the sky and said, ""This is why I stopped believing in you, asshole!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped off my stuff in my apartment. It was all soaked through. I walked down to the bar. It was still two hours till closing and that was plenty to get good and drunk. I ordered a double jack and coke. A friend of mine, a guy from Ireland with no family in the US said, ""So how was your Thanksgiving?"" I laughed, took a big sip and said, ""It'll make a good story someday.""

snandndnf,calwin,"For my food tech project for my PPE (Pre Public Examinations) I made a white bechamel sauce. It didn’t go as expected as I didn’t bring in the appropriate ingredients. I did what I could with the limited resources I had available. As it was the first period of the day I had to carry it round in a container for the rest of the day. As you may know last week in the UK it was a lot hotter than usual so the sauce settled at a sticky texture. 

My cousin from Romania was staying over for the week so I thought I’d surprise her by letting her try some of the sauce I made in school. As I got home I put the container in the freezer to use later. I was making dinner to practice for my next practical exam which was the day after. I decided to use the sauce I made in school with the dinner I was preparing the same night. Before I added the sauce to the dinner I wanted to get an opinion of it so I called my cousin downstairs and put a pot of the sauce in front of her.  As her English isn’t great she doesn’t always understand your intentions so as I put the pot in front of her she looked at me in disgust.

I asked her if she was going to try it and she shouted “NO” she then explained how drinking my cum would be disgusting and she would never do such a thing. I then had to frantically explain how I’d just forgotten some ingredients and the heat had caused it to go into a cum like texture.

usedupgarbage,cakf5l,"Reddit, I've got a doozy of a situation and desperately need advice. This happened last night and I'm still fucked up over it. TL;DR at the bottom.

I have been seeing my partner for a little over 2 months now, and we have fallen fast and hard for each other. I honestly think this one is going to last for a very long time, and he is incredibly special to me.

A couple nights ago, he and I decide to stay up all night on a bender together until he has to go to work at 5AM. Hey, we're both young and we can afford to do that to our bodies still.

That said, I spent all day yesterday recovering and generally being sluggish. My roommate was home and spent the afternoon being a couch potato with me binging Good Omens. 

(Some background: I have been sleeping with my roommate casually for about 2 years. I confessed my romantic feelings for him back in April, he did not return them, but we still remained friends and casual sexual partners. A month later, I met my current boyfriend. All sexual interactions with my roommate ceased shortly after.)

I came to my boyfriend's apartment last night and he again had work at 5AM the next day, so I suggested we go to sleep around 11. He agreed and we moved over to the bed where things started getting frisky. I tried to be sensible and suggested we actually *do* go to bed since 2 nights in a row with no sleep is probably not ideal. But, we both throw responsibility out the window and continue with our session.

Now, here's the fuck up. 

We ended up in doggy style, which isn't a position we've played around with much yet. I, being tired and exhausted from the previous night, was running purely on adrenaline at this point, so I was not completely mentally present.

At this point, my muscle memory takes over and I begin to exclaim the name of my roommate. I stop myself halfway through his name, but it's too late. My boyfriend, who is privy to the fact that my roommate is a former sexual partner, immediately stops and the mood is killed. We do end up finishing our session, but now I think I ruined the one pure relationship I have had in an very long time. 

He claims to not be upset with me, but has stressed that he will never forget this.

What blows is that both of their names are SO similar, and I even warned him beforehand that I might accidentally say my roommate's name because of it.

I've never said a previous sexual partner's name in bed with a different person before. He's never had this happen to him either, so we are both swimming around in uncharted territory.

How do I make this up to him? What can I do to let him know that he's the one that I want? I truly honestly was so tired and had just finished spending the afternoon with my roommate, so I'm hoping there'll be some leniency there.

Reddit, did I ruin this relationship forever?

TL;DR: I said my roommate's name during sex with my boyfriend last night. My roommate was a casual sexual partner of mine for the last 2 years.

EDIT: just to clarify, I live in the Bay Area in California. My lease isn't up until October, so I can't break the lease early or else I forfeit my deposit, which is $2,000. I'm in my 20s and don't have financial support from my parents, so breaking the lease early unfortunately isn't a financially viable option for me. Believe me, if I could move out, I would, but I can't afford to.",tifu,TIFU by saying my roommate's name during sex
SourBitchKids,caj1fz,"I recently came into the possession of a new kind of weed I haven’t tried before. I was excited to experience it and accordingly smoked a fuck ton. I was having a great time, petting my dog and listening to music while I got super relaxed, but around 30 minutes in I started to feel really funny in my throat. Like the dumbass I am, I decided to google it to see if there are other people who experience it and what might have caused it—of course, in WebMD fashion, every link was to resources about weed allergies and anaphylactic shock. I read through the list of symptoms and realize, *oh shit, I’m actually going into anaphylaxis*. I checked my tongue and it was swollen and puckered on the edges. I was lightheaded and having a hard time breathing. I woke my roommate up at 2:30am to drive me to the ER, freaking out the whole way there. In the ER, they admitted me so fast and hooked me up with a blood pressure cuff, EKG electrodes, and an oxygen monitor. Shaking, I turned to look at my stats—which were all fucking normal. Every single one of them was right where it should be. They didn’t even do the EKG. When the doctor examined me, I had to tell him about the weed; he now looked at me with disappointment and shame in his eyes. I sat there high as a kite now experiencing confused embarrassment, starting to joke and giggle like an idiot. They sent me home with a Benadryl. A fool. 

Leaving, I started drinking some water—and in this moment, it was the most heavenly thing I’d ever tasted. I could feel it running down my throat, cooling and relaxing it. Suddenly, I was made very aware that I was biting the edges of my tongue because it was a little numb, and my mouth cavity was as dry as the Sahara Desert. It felt like cotton was shoved into my mouth and the water dissolved it. All at once it hits me—I was fucking dehydrated. The marijuana dried my mouth out and my throat was dry as a consequence. That’s why it was feeling so odd. I’d seriously racked up an (American) ER bill because I forgot to stay hydrated. I dropped a couple hundred dollars for a Benadryl and a cup of water. I drank a fuck ton and now I feel better. 

TLDR; I smoked too much weed and thought I was dying from an allergic reaction, when I was actually just a lil thirsty. I now have to pay for an ER visit because my weed made me parched and paranoid.",tifu,TIFU by smoking too much weed and going into anaphylactic shock
molotok_c_518,calmz3,"This actually happened Saturday morning.

Some background: I have very vivid dreams. Color, sound, touch... I only notice afterwards, when I have woken up, that there's no taste or smell, but when I'm in the dream, I don't miss them at all.

I've had dreams that felt like they lasted days, but after I woke up, I realized I was only out a couple of hours. I've done entire semesters of school, trips to faraway cities, and days-long shopping sprees in the time it takes to watch an episode of *Breaking Bad*.

This also means I have very, very vivid nightmares.

The absolute worst was one where I was stabbed in the chest, and felt myself bleed out. I woke up screaming and trying to pull an invisible knife from my chest. That was very unfun.

You would think that someone with such a history would stay away from movies that may feed into those dreams. You would be wrong.

I love horror movies. They tend to be much more imaginative than most other genres. I'll gleefully binge a day's worth of 80s films over most TV shows.

The final piece of this FU is, my son has been staying with me while he is on probation. He works nights at a local eatery, and comes home around 2-3 PM.

With the background out of the way...

Several weeks ago, I found *From Beyond* streaming for free, with ads, on Vudu. I hadn't watched it in several decades, and decided to see how well it had aged.

It's a weird movie, where a scientist discovers a way to stimulate the pineal gland in the skull to see into a parallel dimension. However ,they can see us. too, and they are very hostile. Brain eating, mutation, and other odd stuff commences. It's not a great film, but it has 4 elements of a favorite of mine, *The Re-Animator*, that made it a must-watch for me: it was based on a Lovecraft story; it has Jeffrey Combs as the protagonist; Barbara Crampton is in it as well; and it has Stuart Gordon directing.

Fast forward to Friday.

I was dreaming that a weird person was electrifying the furniture, and dragging shadow-things out of their dimension into ours. I'm not clear on the why; I think it had something to do with ""check this out, look what I can do!""

At the point where the FU happened, I was screaming, flailing, and trying to keep from being dragged back to the shadow dimension where these things lived.

This is right about when my son came home. He heard me screaming and thrashing, and came into my room to check out what the commotion was about.

When he saw me having a nightmare, he started shaking me to wake me up.

In the dream, something grabbed my shoulder, and I swung out to knock it off.

In real life, I swung out and punched him in the mouth.

His yelling and cursing finally woke me up. I spent the next hour trying to help him stem the bleeding of a busted lip.

He hasn't spoken to me since.

lloydfoxe,cajaei,"Not today but about 15 years ago, I had a really late night (was out at a LAN party). Like, so tired I wasn’t sure I was safe to drive home. 

Got home, decided to brush my teeth per bedtime routine despite the hour. 

Here’s the thing ... I was really tired, and apparently brushed my teeth a little roughly, and my aim wasn’t good. Instead of brushing my teeth, my aim was high - the end of the toothbrush went through the flap of skin that holds your top lip to your top gums, right under your nose. I looked it up and apparently it’s a frenulum. 

The pain was some of the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. 0/10, would not recommend l, even with rice. 

 Googled it at the time looking for treatment advice but only found child abuse articles, no help for how to patch yourself back up. 

15 years ago and it hasn’t grown back, at least it stopped hurting after a few days. 

TLDR; performed unplanned body modification surgery on myself with a toothbrush. Did not enjoy it.",tifu,TIFU by brushing my teeth
dohertya,caho1c,"This happened a few minutes ago. The title sounds fake, but hear me out.

A few days ago I received a small package in the mail. I saw that it had my name on it, but for some reason I didn't open it. Usually I would, but I hadn't ordered anything and wasn't expecting mail, so I left it on the table. I'm temporarily living with my sister in her apartment, so both of us check the mail semi-frequently.

Today my sister brought in another small package sent to me in the mail, also from a Chinese address/company. When she mentioned that another piece of mail came for me, I started to wonder who the packages were from and what was in them.

So as shes talking about her day, I begin to open up the largest package. I pull out a roughly 6 inch long skinny object wrapped in plastic. Then another smaller object. Upon closer inspection, I realize they're two small dildos with suction cups on the end of them. Meanwhile my sister hasn't looked at what I've opened.

""Oh my god, what is this?"" I say, mostly out of amusement. I show my sister the small pink dildo and a longer but really skinny black dildo. I am a male by the way, if that matters to you for this story.

""Oh! Wow."" She says. At that point I was just confused who sent these to me and why I received them. I start to open the next package, and inside are two squishy silicon boobs and a silicon penis head. I keep telling my sister ""This is so weird, I don't know who would send this to me"". But then I realize, she probably thinks that I bought these sex toys for myself and I'm now trying to cover up my weird fethishy purchase.

""It's okay buddy, you know I totally don't care if you're into that"" she said. ""I actually have some lube if you want."" I tell her again that I didn't buy them, and that if I did and was into the dildo butt magic, I would feel comfortable enough to let her know. It felt so weird defending myself against the purchase of sex toys that I didn't buy, when it looked like I REALLY DID buy them and was afraid to admit it.

I was just sitting there with two dildos, two small squishy penis heads (with small black eyes on them mind you, and two silicon boobs in my lap feeling like a defeated and sex-addicted goblin.

""I don't know how to explain this to you, but you know that I **would** tell you if I had actually bought these and wouldn't feel weird about it. I just ***do*** feel weird because I feel like you think I'm lying but I'm not, I just actually didn't buy these."" I said.

I know my sister well enough to the point that I could tell she thought I was lying to her.

My sister awkwardly laughs and said ""It's okay buddy :)"".

I kept trying to explain, but then stopped because I realized no matter what I said wouldn't change the appearance of the situation.

So. From now on in her eyes I'm the brother that sticks these cool Chinese dildos up my butt and plays with squishy silicon boob and penis heads.

TL;DR: Two packages were sent to me containing dildos and other sex toys. I don't know who sent them to me. My sister, despite me telling her that I didn't buy them and would tell her if I did, thinks that I purchased them for myself.",tifu,TIFU by opening sex toys in front of my sister

Our fateful tale starts after a crazy Friday at my work, a day full of back to back meetings and presentations with no time to truly recover between them. This Friday was also the day I had to bring my push bike back home so I could take it on holiday the next week. 


After the workday is over I get onto my train home, drop my bags on a bag rack and place the bike in the storage straps provided on the train, and promptly pass the fuck out. Whilst it's normal for me to doze on the train I rarely truly 'sleep' which means I don't ever set an alarm for my stop as I'll usually be alert enough to get myself up for it. This day however I slept right past my stop and ended up waking up just before the stop 3 more down the line from my planned destination... Shit.


I jump up and in a dreary daze I grab by bag and jacket and hop off the train. The more eagle eyed of you may have realised I left sormthing, I had not at this point in time. I do realise however when I turn round to check the dot matrix to check the time and see my bike departing the station on this train whilst I'm still on the platform.


I find some station staff to admit my mistake and they look at me and repeat what I left, obviously confirming me as the moron that I am. They then call the other stops along the route to see if the bike can be retrieved from the train, it cannot. However I can hear laughter down the phone from each station.


I end up having to pay £20 catch another train to the terminal station and finding their station manager, who brings me to the staff room to reclaim the bike. 


I eventually get home with bike 3 hours late and £20 poorer. The most expensive nap I've ever taken.

EepeesJ1,camehi,"Happened many years ago while I was still in college but the story came up the other day and thought it'd be fun to share here.

I was super poor in undergrad. Homeless for a year before getting myself into an apartment after I found a full-time job refurbishing cell phones. Girlfriend (who's now my wife of almost 15 years) went to the same school and things were looking up for me in Duloc. I worked the late shift so I never got back home before midnight and I was also attending classes in the mornings before work. I was exhausted almost every day, but loved feeling productive and grown up.

One day while at work, I remembered I had a presentation due first thing in the morning. The presentation could be about anything, but it had to include a PowerPoint and be given in German. Pretty simple, but I forgot to make a PowerPoint for the presentation. Here's the FU. I call my girlfriend from work and ask her if she can piece something together I can present in class. ""What's your presentation supposed to be about?"" - ""Whatever you want. Feel free to write in English. I'll wing it as I go through the slides."" I was still fluent in German at the time, so this was gonna be a piece of cake. My wife is one of the smartest people I know, but at the time we were only about a year or two into our relationship and... well, we were very much in love. Still are, but... keep reading.

I get home around 1am, and found she had left a flash drive on my bed with a cute little note. I didn't plug it in to check it, because she's smarter than me. I assumed it was going to be interesting. I get up in the morning after about 3 hours sleep because World of Warcraft, and make my way over to class. Presentation 1 is some girl talking about German government. Presentation 2, some guy talking about German culture in general. Presentation 3, my turn.

I plug in the flash drive and load it up. The first screen has a picture of me and my name. Cool, I introduce myself and tell everyone I look forward to presenting my topic to them. Slide 2, it's a picture of me as a baby with a quick little blurb about my age and where I was born. I pause, staring at the projector screen. Oh no... Please dear God... She didn't...

Slide 3, it's a picture of me stretching at karate practice and a quick blurb about how long I've been training...

Slide 4, it's a picture of me and something about my favorite foods...

Slide 5, it's a picture of my favorite movie...

My girlfriend made me a presentation... about me. With every slide I died a little more inside and wished I would wake up from the nightmare. It went on for an agonizingly long amount of time because I told her the presentation needed to be somewhere around 10-15 minutes. My hands were sweaty and shaking more and more with each slide. I was praying at some point the topic would change or there would be some kind of plot twist to make this not about me. The last slide is a selfie of us in my car and I'm making a really stupid face holding a tiny stuffed bunny to my cheek. I turn to the class and thank them for listening and allowing me to share a bit about myself. I think only half the class hesitantly offered some weak applause and laughs. I sat down at my desk and packed up my stuff. I don't remember what the next presentation was about because I was staring at the ceiling in disbelief for the remainder of class. Skipped the rest of the semester out of embarrassment and only attended the final. Everyone addressed me by name, like they were saying hi to an old friend they knew everything about.

Well, sitting right in front of me was my razor. I have never shaved anywhere other than my face before, and I was kinda curious to see how shaving went down there. So I shaved a little bit, thought it was kinda neat (kinda satisfying), then I was like, ok I’ll just make it even. Oh I’ll do a little bit more, it won’t really hurt nobody will

QueryTA,caizj4,"Throwaway account because my friends are aware of my main account, plus I'm ashamed of this. 

This actually happened yesterday so, YIFU. 

TL:DR at the bottom for the lazy readers. 

My girlfriend recently asked me what Reddit was, because she see's me use it a lot and I also get a lot of notifications. I briefly explained what it is and emphasized that Reddit is just an application to get the latest news, memes and so on. I also mentioned that there aren't any profiles with real names and pictures (like Facebook). She obviously believed me and moved on. 

Yesterday, we were at the beach and when I was next to her, browsing Reddit (yes, I was on Reddit whilst I was at the beach with my girlfriend, shut up), I decided to show her how it works. Whilst I was holding out my phone, scrolling down and showing her that notifications I get are just post replies, she told me to go on 'Messages'. Without any hesitation, I tapped on it and started scrolling down to show her that the messages are just auto bot replies (I had forgotten about the message that I'll talk about soon). One of the messages was a message that I have sent to a girl on r/RealGirls (the message was sent before my girlfriend and I were dating). The title was ""A message for a hot lady"". My girlfriend obviously wanted to open the message to see what it was and tried tapping on it to open it. I don't know why, I moved away and tried to delete it but I couldn't (fuck whoever designed it not to be deleted). My girlfriend saw me attempting to delete and got super pissed plus she started crying because she thought that I was cheating on her and that I had contact with another girl (she does not understand the concept that Reddit is nothing like Instagram and Facebook). The text in the message was something like this ""You're really hot, I wish that we lived in the same country because I would have taken you on a date. Here's my Instagram.."". I continued to lie and deny that this message even existed.. fuck I'm stupid. 

After a lot of crying I told her the truth and she is obviously mad that I lied, not because of the message. So I had to uninstall Reddit from my phone because she is thinking that I use Reddit for porn.

Yarrhful,caicip,"I was on my way to the airport. I'd just been picked up by may manager (who was half an hour late already) for a work trip to Italy. Eta is about 1 hour from now, leaving us 2 hours before departure. We're doing good. 

We get half way to the airport and it hits me. ""Pete? What's the one thing ya need to get on a plane?"" ""you're fucking kidding me"". So around we turn, speeding back home to grab may passport before speeding back again to get back to the airport. That's added a good 1hr40 to the 3 hours spare we had. Had.

We get to the M3 motorway. 6 miles of stand still traffic. It's cramped, we're bored, it's hot, we're late.
Once we get through that shit storm, we get to the airport carpark with approximately 1hr to spare before the plane takes off. It then takes us 10 minutes to find a parking spot, so we then grab our stuff and run the the bus stop.
""nah mate, this bus is only drop off. You need to go to zone W to get picked up"". Why the driver can't pickup AND drop off in one trip baffles me. Either way, we run back to zone W (past the car) and wait for a bus. And wait. And wait. Considering this bus service is 'every 12 minutes' we thought it'd be quicker than this!

We get the bus to the airport, get to check-in, wait 10 minutes in a queue, you know the drill. Now for baggage check in. The boarding pass wouldn't scan. ""excuse me, can you help, we're running a little late"" ""yeah, you've missed your flight mate"" huh, what? We have 30 mins before take off, what ya in about?
Turns out baggage check in stops 40 mins before the flight is scheduled to leave. Fuck.

The best solution in that shit period of time was for my manager to take the bags on the next flight, a quoted 1 hours time, and they escort me through the airport to my gate.

Security. My cabin bags are fine, my laptop good, but me? ""beep"". Fuck me. Maybe the iron in my blood is too dense or maybe its because I have a fat head, I dunno, but a quick frisk from a cute blonde and I'm away again, cabin bag in tow.

I sprint, I mean sprint across to the gate almost dying because I can't run for shit. I get the the gate, it's delayed. What? All of this and the plane is late? Fml.

I get on the plane, try not to have a panic attack as this is the first time flying alone, to a foreign country with a language I don't understand.

I get the the air port, everything is going fine, I get past security, grab my bag and head off into the unknown.

It's now 10:30pm. I start trying to figure out a way to get the the hotel as I'm not old enough to drive the hire car that was arranged. Google maps was a life saver!

I get a phone call from my manager ""check in at the hotel closed at 10"" what? I'm in a foreign country, with no way of communicating, and now nowhere to sleep? Fucking brilliant. Better still, he tells me his next flight isn't until 6am the following morning, meaning that I basically need to hang around for 12 hours before he lands.

I find an alternative hotel (thank god for company credit cards) but its about an hours walk. I see the queue for the taxi and its about 500 yards long. Fuck that. I started walking when a guys comes up to me asking me questions in Italian. ""English?"" ""oh you want taxi?"" fuck yeah, jackpot. He takes me to his friend and I realise that this is how people get mugged and/or murdered. Using translate I crudely ask to see some ID. He shows me a driving licence and I snap a pic to send to my family. ""if I die, its this guy"" was all that was said.

(I realise now that was a really stupid thing to do and I'm lucky that it went so well)

He took 25 euro off me (when mytaxi was quoting less than 10, but I was sort of near a hotel and alive so I called it a win.
I stumbled into the hotel at 12am. The lovely guy at the desk is very helpful, but unfortunately due to me asking for the cheapest room, I got the 5th floor loft space. 
I use the lift to get the top of the building, and it's one of the most janky lift I think I've been in. Bearing in mind that I get super claustrophobic, and don't like lifts at the best of times.

I get the the room, and the door doesn't open. Fucking key card isn't working. I run back down the stairs, he that fixed, run back up. I'm in. There's a bed. I can sleep. Finally.
I realise I haven't had anything to drink in 12 hours, and even that was a can of monster,so my fluids are low. I run back down to the from desk to see a vending machine, grab some water, and run back up.

Just as I'm getting in bed I realise. Fuck. All my toiletries and still with my manager in Gatwick Airport. Yet again, I run down to the front desk and ask for at least a toothbrush and they happily provide.

I'm currently sat here waiting for my manager to land so he can come pick me up, but I've had possibly the most stressful day I've ever had today.

TL;DR: forgot my passport, that and traffic made us late for the airport, couldn't check the hold luggage in so we split up, I took the flight and my manger had to wait 12 hours for the next one. Ended up in Italy on my own, with no hotel or transport. Got a really dodgy 'taxi' and found a hotel to find that all of my toiletries were still in the UK. Didn't die!

nikkuhlee,cao1og,"I decided yesterday to make a little box to transport my minis for D&amp;D/Pathfinder because I got some new ones with tiny arms and bendable pieces I want to protect. I bought a little box to paint, and grabbed the spray primer we use for building dungeon tiles and other props. 

The nozzle was clogged, and despite my best efforts it seemed like it was going to stay that way, so I decided to just use an extra layer of paint and skip the primer since I wasn’t TOO concerned about it. Our back door is next to our computer desk, so I set the primer there when I walked back inside. About an hour later, I get up to toss a paper plate and suddenly I hear a hissing noise. 

The primer has begun to spray itself, and the nozzle is aimed directly at the computer screen of my PC. It took a solid few seconds of disbelief for me to get my shit together and stick the paper plate in front of the spray while yelling for my boyfriend to come open the back door. In a panic, I tried popping the nozzle off, but then it just started spewing from the hole in the top of the container.  By the time I got the can outside and in a bag, I had black primer splattered up to my elbows, my computer screen was half-covered, and there were spray droplets all over my desk, keyboard, mousepad, etc. 

Luckily I was able, with a great deal of effort and an old credit card, to scrape it off most of the monitor. There’s a small cloudy spot in the bottom corner, and now I have an excuse to save up for a 4k monitor.

Anyways, the HR representative said that while it's not technically in the companies office, it certainly was inappropriate. I let them finish and then told them what actually happened. I told them about the social media post and they took a look. We then had a good laugh. They said that they will let the person that made the complaint know what really happened.

CRXGlobal,cany08,"I have had a number of job interviews recently that went poorly and did not result in securing employment.

I started to think I needed to do something during an interview to really stand out, be impressive, unique, and highly memorable. I thought it could be risky, but might work out.

I came up with the following idea: After concluding the interview, after the hand shakes, etc, when leaving the room stop, turn around, and say ""There's one more thing you need to know about me.""

Then pull out a bottle of hot sauce, down the entire bottle, slam it onto the ground and say ""I can handle the heat."" Nod confidently, leave the room.

Boom.

I imagined that they would be really impressed and wowed by such a performance.

Well it didn't pan out like I thought it would. It was only a small bottle of hot sauce, I figured it would be no big deal to actually do. I should have tested at home first, but I didn't.

I was nervous as a bitch-ass during the interview, but I was determined to follow through with the plan.

So I started exactly as described above. I was leaving, I turned around, maybe not with as much swagger as I'd imagined in my head, and I declared ""There's one more thing you need to know about me.""

I pulled out the hot sauce bottle, almost dropped it, and started to open the bottle. In my head it was all one quick confident motion, like an electric Indiana Jones, but instead I fumbled around and had a tough time getting it open. It felt like a nightmarish eternity but was probably only about 20 seconds. Enough time for one of the interviewers to ask me what I was doing.

I didn't answer directly. Instead, after I got the bottle open, I repeated ""There's one more thing you need to know about me."" (But stuttering.)

Then I guzzled down the entire bottle of hot sauce. I instantly regretted it. My mouth and throat felt like lava was swirling around inside me. I immediately started to gag and loudly cough, I was crying involuntarily. Tears hardcore streaming down my face. I was sweating like a terrible fool.

I desperately tried to scream ""I can handle the heat"" but just kept coughing before I could get anything out.

The interviewers were all standing up looking at me in horror and confusion.

A few seconds before I threw up all over the floor I knew it would happen, but I tried to hold it back. I couldn't.

I threw up all over the floor. It hurt as much on the way out as it did on the way in, if not more so. The vomit felt like flaming barbed wire shredding its way through my neck.

I should mention a disturbing amount of fiery mucus was also leaking out of my nose uncontrollably.

After I finished throwing up I could not bear to look at the interviewers. I hoarsely mumbled an apology and started to stumble as quickly as possible out the door.

I have never been more shamed in my life.

I didn't get the job.

Masturbating_Jedi,canwrx,"This whole ordeal happened when I was in college, but it was only until about a week ago I realized what my room mate was *really trying to tell me*. I'm just posting this with a main account of mine because I have no shame.


So, lets get to it then. I spent a summer semester of my senior year living with three other fairly good friends of mine. I was only going to be living there over the summer before living arrangements would change. We all liked to party, so we had friends over frequently. I was pretty shy and especially awkward, still am albeit a little less so. My friends were all super confident guys that seemed to hook up all the time and I was pretty much left to my own devices. I've had a few flings of my own, but nothing steady to really keep me from feeling lonely and frustrated. I always wanted to be confident in myself and wondered why I wasn't ""normal"" like my friends were. My insecurities never really shook me to my core, but it did leave me with some, uh, tendencies.We also didn't have central air at the time, so needless to say, this helped contribute towards this sticky situation along with my aforementioned frustrations.


I was in and out of the shower fairly frequently, usually twice a day since it was so hot out. And since I lived in a party house and people were constantly in and out, I figured it best to just vent my frustrations in the shower for privacy purposes. Simple enough, I'd just hop in the shower, start stroking it, and aim at the shower drain while I finish. This became a bit of a habit for me to hop in the shower, shake hands with the beast, wash, rinse, repeat. I thought nothing of it and went about the rest of my day.


Come move out day, another one of my room mates was moving out with me as well and we had split cleaning duties. What I forgot to mention about this shower was that it didn't drain like it should have, and of course my buddy decided to clean the bathroom. So later in the evening we were sitting on the porch, just my buddy and I, when he started talking about cleaning the bathroom. He looked me in the eyes and started talking about how there was all this semen caked into the tub, how our other room mate was so disgusting, how we all knew the drain didn't work properly, why he couldn't just fap in bed like a normal human being, etc. He just kept laying into our mutual friend. I figured I was in the clear and dodged that bullet since he seemed to be blaming our buddy. I did know the shower drain was slow, but I figured that ""the water would just get it"" and that ""it's really just white on white, so you won't even be able to tell."" I guess I was just being selfish and gross, letting my other three friends step in my seed while they took their showers instead of taking a closer look and cleaning up after myself. Not only was I being super gross, I was happily letting my friend take the fall to avoid my own shame. And I had been relieving this tension once or twice a day for about three months, so there was probably just oodles of semen caked to the tub. 


About a week ago I was laying in bed, doing that thing where your mind just races at night, reliving all your shameful moments. I started thinking deeper. My friend who cleaned the bathroom wasn't calling out our mutual friend, he was calling me out. He was telling me how disgusting I was to my face and I didn't even realize that. I thought it was strange how personal he was getting, but he was really just trying to guilt me. He wanted to see how I'd react when presented the gross news. I guess I can't say for certain he knew it was me, and maybe he was just probing to find out who did it. I'm not sure how he could have known for sure, but his accusations did seem strangely personal.

SpunkySpaceCat,canwbz,"I am quite the horny bastard. I've had numerous dreams and fantasies (mostly dreams thank God) of quite embarrassing sexual situations. Just to name a few, I've had dreams where I've been fucked and sucked by my math teacher (he's really hot, but I couldn't look at him right the next day), doing the nasty with my sister (she's not biological but still pretty hecked up amirite) and my two brothers (again, not biological but still pretty not okay) and quite a few other dreams that aren't quite worth mentioning. In hindsight, my dreams (like everyone else's) are weird and wet and quite worrisome.

Also, like any other curious teenager with a raging sex drive that cannot be quenched, I'm often apt to open an incognito tab and do some squeak squeaking with my down belows on pornhub. All of this stuff I'm mentioning is nasty nasty, but it happens to the best of us.

Moving on, last night I decided to read some hentai manga because why the fuck not. My manga app has a shitton of hentai and I read it. The plot of this particular hentai (if there even was one) was about this gal who uhhhhhhhh basically fucks her dog.

Japan is weird

ANYWAYS I read it (no I did not masturbate to it you nasty pervs) and then decided I had lost faith in humanity and went on to go to bed. Note that these wet dreams always occur after I've watched some porn or something.  So I go to bed fully expecting some fucked up wet dream and I'm ready for it.

I won't get into the nitty gritty of last night's dream, but damn it was a doozy. The rough outline of it is this:

1. Meet hot anime girl with long blonde hair (apparently I swapped genders in this dream from F to M)
2. Take walk in park
3. Get really horny with each other after finding another couple doing the do in their car
4. Try to find secluded place to sex each other
5. Everywhere is full
6. Decide to sneak out of park and do it
7. Like 3 minutes in, ye pants down and dick in
8. All goes well untillllll

YEP!!! WILD DOG APPEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!

And it's all downhill from there.

Dog has human dick, decides to join in for a not-so-hot threesome. I can't exactly remember the feeling of having a dog in a threesome, but I can only describe it as humanlike. Hey man, dreams are fucked up.

Here's where the real fuck up begins. In the dream.

So we're in hot action, dog, anime girl and all. Then I get a phone call from my mom (dream mom) and I answer it. What I'm greeted with is ""where the fuck are you it's like 3 a.m. and you're not home."" Oops. Then out of nowhere, dream mom barges down the bathroom door (like some freaking hulk figure or some shit) where we're fucking and her eyes are cursed with the image of her daughter (now son) in some action with an anime girl and a dog. Hoorah.

From then on it's a blur. The only thing I remember is dream mom saying ""I understand"" and then I broke up with anime girl even though we were both still horny and then dog leaves me alone. So in my dream world, I'm left with only a boner and some insatiable horniness.

Fast forward to real world. I wake up in a cold sweat and I see my mom looking at me. I have a job interview in an hour, so I gotta get ready.

I stare at mom and these words exit my mouth before I can even think them.

""I'm sorry for having sex at 16. I tried not to but it's so hard. I'm sorry for failing you.""

Then I realize that it was all just a really vivid dream and dream mom isn't real mom but real mom just learned what dream mom witnessed and she just stares at me. Then she leaves without a word. I mentally stab myself.

I'm left on my bed baffled and I'm drenched in cold sweat and a feeling of wanting a dick in my vagina.

And my underwear was quite simply soaked in discharge.

Hooray for teenage sex drives!!!!!!!

I get up, change my underwear, and get ready for interview. I get in the shower and wipe my downsides. During the interview I can't focus because I'm really horny for some reason and there's a hot guy sitting across from me. So there goes my one chance for a job.

I get home and I see my dogs. Nervous breakdown.

Then I see my mom. She's doing dishes. I try to walk in unnoticed but she stares me down and demands why I said that this morning.

My only response was, ""I had a weird dream.""

So now my mom thinks that I'm not a virgin and I can't make eye contact with any dogs. And not to mention I'm still really thirsty for some dick.

xJeanna612x,camgtb,"This happened a couple days ago while I was at work. Here is some information to help with understanding the story. I work in a retail store. The way the store is laid out is in the back of the store is the office, break room, and bathrooms. I was taking my break in my car because the break room is always cold.

I was headed to clock in after finishing my lunch break. As I'm walking back to the back of the store, I'm snacking on some berries and cherries chewy Sweetarts. I chomp down on the delicious candy, but shortly after my first chomp something went wrong. I'm not sure if it was a mixture of the candy and my saliva going down the wrong tube, the slightly sour candy irritating my throat, or a combination of both. I start choking, not on the candy itself, but the candy saliva mixture. However this wasn't the typical choking on your saliva feeling. I started coughing and then my throat started to close and I couldn't breathe. I walked towards the doors as I'm panicking and making ridiculous gasping noises. I'm wondering how long it will be before I can breathe again. I'm trying to decide if I should go to the office and hope someone is in there or go to the Pharmacy for help, but I was also hoping that I would begin to breathe again soon. After I gasped for air about 6-10 times, I finally am able to breathe but I begin to cough like I have never coughed before. I was shaking and coughing but it was a lot better than not being able to breathe.

curioussssscas,calujx,"This fuck up happened just yesterday. My boyfriend and i have been doing psychedelics for a while now, and we decided that he was going to take me to the zoo, a public museum, and a movie while I trip. We started with the zoo. Now, at this zoo, there was a little rope tunnel designed for kids to climb through. My boyfriend dared me to go through it, so I did. This was where the fuck up happened. 

Going through the tunnel, I decided I wasn’t going to use my hands because it looked gross. I was doing just fine, even my boyfriend was surprised. “I’m surprised at how good your balance is, I don’t even think I could do that.”  Well, I very quickly showed him that I, in fact, couldn’t do it. At the very end of the rope tunnel, I tried to do a little hop out of it. My foot got caught, and I quite literally face planted out of the rope tunnel. My foot came out of my shoe, I smashed my knee, my shoulder, and my chin on the rocky ground. I tried to keep it together, but pain on LSD is not a fun thing. I looked around and noticed that I had just fallen out of a ROPE TUNNEL designed for KIDS in front of everyone around me. I was covered in dirt, I looked absolutely ridiculous. I was embarrassed, in pain, scared, humiliated, dirty, you get the idea. I had come to the realization that I had just completely humiliated myself, and continued to do so by crying my eyes out like a toddler. It doesn’t end there though. 

After realizing I couldn’t really clean myself off with the small bottle of water we had, I went to find a bathroom. Now let me tell you, the bathroom I found was the worst possible place I could’ve gone to clean off. There were no paper towels. There was no soap. The sink was automatic and I couldn’t get it to stay on longer than 3 seconds at a time. Imagine trying to clean off your face, shoulder, and legs with occasional water and shitty 1 ply toilet paper that disintegrates basically as soon as it comes into contact with water. It was *horrible*. While my boyfriend waited outside, I was having a mental breakdown in the bathroom because *how the fuck was I supposed to clean myself off with no fucking paper towels?* Thank god nobody was in there with me, because I looked and acted incredibly insane. I was sobbing, covered in filth, and talking to myself. “Why are there no paper towels? What the fuck am I supposed to do, use a whole roll of toilet paper? Why the fuck won’t this sink stay on? God, I look so ridiculous.” That’s just a few of the things I said to myself, while also violently chucking the wads of wet toilet paper I had used into the trash can. 

In the end, it was alright. After I came out of the bathroom, we sat down at a table outside of one of the food buildings. We used napkins and a bottle of water to clean off, while one of the workers gave me a couple bandaids for my knee. My knee and chin hurt for the rest of the day, but thankfully it didn’t *completely* ruin my trip. But lemme tell ya, pain and public humiliation are NOT things you want to experience on LSD.


Tl;dr : Took LSD and went to the zoo, fell out of a children’s rope tunnel and busted my knee, shoulder and chin. Had to clean myself up in a bathroom with no paper towels and a sink that would only stay on 3 seconds at a time. 0/10 recommend.",tifu,TIFU by tripping balls at the zoo.

This happened on the 4th as we celebrated Independence Day. I bought a new grill last summer but never got around to using it. My girlfriend and I were hosting a gathering at our house and I figured it was the perfect opportunity to christen the grill.

My brother and I perused the instruction manual and were mocking it, saying if you have to read the manual you probably shouldn't be grilling. He specifically read aloud the warning that the grill should be at least 10 feet from the nearest structure.

Fast-forward to us all sitting around enjoying our food when a family friend quickly called me over and told me to look around the side of my house. A section of the vinyl siding was charred and buckled, having melted from the heat of the grill. He and I lifted the grill and moved it - oh, I don't know...maybe 10 feet - away from the house.

About 6 slats are melted and will have to be replaced. My girlfriend isn't thrilled right now.

Dear lord. On my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so I clicked the user name and looked through the profile. I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

This is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read.

I now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.

I know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising.

I know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

I know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife’s room.

In reading through the comments he’s made to others, I’ve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.

Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit.

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money.

HYThrowaway1980,caklih,"Obligatory this happened last night.

So there is obviously more to this than the post title suggests.

I was going to post this on AITA, but am definitely the asshole here. I was misguidedly trying to be honest, which has to be a cornerstone of any marriage, except in this situation...

Last night my wife and I were talking about self-perception, and I said that I am probably a bit too focussed on my own appearance because my mother would often tell me when I was younger if I was looking a bit fat (I’ve never really been skinny, but I have been powerful/muscular with a tendency towards being overweight).

My wife then replies with: “well, that’s ironic because your mother’s no great beauty herself”.

Now, perhaps there was something lost in translation, but in my experience “no great beauty” is a euphemism for ugly.

My mother is certainly not ugly, and in her youth was quite actively pursued by a lot of men (as an illustrating and interesting side note, she turned down Omar Sharif at the height of his fame).

I disagreed, at which point my wife said she thought she was prettier than my mother.

And this is where I fucked up.

By way of background, my wife is not classically beautiful, and she is obese (as am I). I did not marry her because I thought she was physically and objectively a knockout, I married her because I think she is the most all-round beautiful person I’ve ever known. Looks fade, and neither of us are spring chickens. If marriage was based on looks and physical attraction alone, I doubt many marriages would last beyond fifteen or twenty years.

So I did the stupid thing and said that, objectively, I think my mother in her twenties and thirties was more attractive than my wife. 

My wife then doubled down, pulling up photos of my mum and her side by side and started criticising my mum’s features. So then I REALLY fucked up, and criticised my wife’s features in return.

My wife is now convinced that I fancy my mother and has said she no longer wants to have children with me.

EDIT: I should add that I am double the twat because my wife has huge self-image problems, and suffered from eating disorders for much of her adult life before she met me.

TL;DR: I got drawn into comparing my wife’s features to my mother’s, which I did, unfavourably to my wife. My wife now thinks I have incest issues and doesn’t want to have children with me.

TheNintendoBoy,cakjql,"So I like playing video games (I know, great intro). I used to be a Nintendo-only gamer, but I recently expanded my horizons by buying a PS4 Slim on Boxing Day of last year. It was a decision I have not regretted. Not only have I gotten to play games that I always wanted to play (RDR2 and HZD), but now I have the best of both worlds with the Switch for Nintendo and indies and PS4 for everything else. But that’s not the story here. 

So, when I got my PS4, I linked my Facebook account to my PSN account. I did this so I could see my FB friends profiles and so I could share cool screenshots to my feed. Anyway, an annoying thing that I had noticed had been going on recently was that my PS4 was sharing the games I played and achievements I got to my feed without me knowing. I only learned that this had been going on when I got a couple notifications about friends liking these posts. I initially thought, “That’s weird. I’ll fix it later.” No. I should have done it right there and then.

So, over the past week, I had been playing Doom (The 2016 reboot is awesome and I can’t wait for Eternal) and last night I bought Wolfenstein The New Order while it was on sale, For context, I’m also a Christian. I know, plenty of Christians play violent video games and that doesn’t affect their beliefs and I’m in the same boat, but it isn’t the type of game you say you love playing to your Christian peers. My mum would rather that I would play something less adult and gory, but she’s fine with letting me play this sort of stuff. So I’m jamming some Wolfenstein and I get a notification from my phone that my granddad on my father’s side had commented on a link I “shared.” Alarm bells started ringing in my head. My granddad is very much a Christian (Don’t worry, he’s not homophobic or racist) and I would rather not let him find out that I played these type of games. So I click on the notification, expecting to see the icon for Wolfenstein The New Order. No, I get something worse. I see the poster for Doom. The poster of Doom with the Doom Slayer choking an Imp (or Unwilling, I never really looked at it closely) in mid-air. The comment below reads this:
“DOOM or DELIVERANCE-Option?”
I gotta hand it to him, that was kinda clever, but I digress. Right now, I was concerned that my very Christian granddad found out that his Christian grandson played a game where you shoot the shit out of demons. I immediately deleted the post and every other achievement and post that the PS4 shared and then I proceeded to change the settings so it wouldn’t share stuff like this anymore.

I know, I know, small mistake in a sea of Redditors way more screwed than I am, but it could make for a very awkward conversation at the dinner table at the next family get-together.

I am a 22 Y/O male 

One of my best friends came out as gay a few years ago and I was glad to be there for him when he did. However as the years go by, he would keep mentioning how ""cute"" I was and I that I would have made a great gay guy. The more I spent time with him I really came to appreciate his company as he was one of the only people who I really loved having good conversation with. 

We hung out and went to see movies together alone usually because my other friends couldn't make it. 

We had always been joking about me possibly being Bi and honestly the thought didn't absolutely scare me off. 

I made the mistake of telling him that maybe I was Bi, and either way I was willing to open my mind to the idea. 

I felt comfortable telling him about guys I thought looked attractive and overall wasn't ashamed of what I might possibly feel. 

This is where it all went south. I invited him and my best friends over and he was the only one who showed up. We ended up watching a movie and basically cuddling on the couch. (I had told him before how much I appreciate physical touch no matter who it's from, but as a purely physical comfort.) 

The movie is coming to a close and we get really close. I'm super tired from a long day so I just don't give a shit. 

I honestly have no idea what really got me started but I thought that if I would just kinda to along with it I might enjoy it. I felt extremely off due to the fast that I had never been so close with a man. 

It all became a blur and we just kinda started going at it, (no penetration or kissing happened, but I was horny and it felt good. 

However as the night went on I started to feel worse and worse about it, but I was too afraid to say anything about it. I hate hurting peoples feelings and he seemed to happy. By the time we were done I was in shock. I thought if if I just kept going it might get better but it never did. 

So here I am disgusted with myself and terrified of what just happened. This absolutely cemented my my mind that I cannot be bi, or at least definitely not with him. 

My emotions are fried and now he thinks I want a relationship. I'm scared to talk to him and tell his how I feel.

I have a lot of time though. He never drinks alcohol except on game nights with his friends playing board games and he never drinks absinthe or really any of his booze.

It was yesterday at 11:00 pm when my mom noticed that i (17M) was geting ready to go out whit my friends to a party. This isin't an issue with most of the people that i now, but i come from a religius family that doesn't see alcohol and partys as something good, so therefore my mom doesn't allow me to go out and have a life. Okey so wile i was getting ready my mom remembered to me that i will not leave the house without her consentment, so i said of course and i went to my bedroom. When my parents where asleep, i went out from a window that is conected with the garden of my house, and climbed to the roof and almost broke a foot jumping to the street side of the house (i have to do this cause my parents locked all the doors and took the keys). When i was finally free i whent to my friends house, had some drinks and headed to the party. The party was good and i had a good time with my friends as usual. But this is where the fuck up start.
I come back to my house and climb to the roof as i did before, but this time i tried to open the window from where i escaped and it was fucking LOCKED. I traied to enther opening the backdoor but then i remembered it was locked to. So there i am, freezing in the midle of the night and i don't now what to do. Then i remember, my house is made in a way that i can climb easily to the roof and from there i have good spots to enter inside. So there is this spot that is licke an inside plase of my house that has no roof (we call it inside garden even if has no plants) and from there you have the window tho my room parents and another that goes to the kitchen. So i climb to there and my dumbass make some noisses that wake up my dog, and as the good boy he is, he start to bark from inside to the unknow sound. My parents wake up, i see the light of their bedroom turn on and some noise that i presume is my father geting out of the bed. And now i am hiding in the roof of my house above to my parents dorm and waiting for them to fall asleep before i fucking die in this winther cold ass night at 5:51 am.

Update: so now have been 6 hours after the insident and almost everithing its going well, i waited almost half an hour in the roof, and by the time i decided it was enough i jumped down to the garden and opened the window, entered the kitchen and went to sleep (my dog dind't bark this time because he recognized me when i was entering the kitchen). At this point i was so freezed that i didn't care if my parents where asleep, but luckily for me they didn't noticed the noises. I think im pretty much safe but i going to stay in my bedroom. I will update the post if something else happens.

I whent out to a party that i wasn't allowed, just to come back and accidently wake up my parents so now im waiting in the roof for them to fall sleep again TL:DR.",tifu,TIFU by going out to a party that i wasn't allowed and waking up my parents while triying to sneak back in my house

So earlier while my gf was asleep in the living room with her brother watching tv I went to our room to play 2k, now while I was playing my dick decided that it had to be relieved as it had been a little while, I go to our bathroom which has the only entrance in our room and proceed to choke my chicken as as I start getting close I look up and my girlfriend is now in the bathroom (I also fucked up by leaving both doors open) and I stop and pull my pants up and close it all while shes using the bathroom she leaves and I leave after her we don’t speak about it or anything. About an hour and a half later I go into the living room everything’s fine cool we go smoke a cigarette I take longer so she goes inside and she’s in bed with the lights off so i know she’s upset. I’m not tired but I get in bed and browse reddit and my boss texts me about work and I turn my phone on silent and keep browsing I get horny again and decide to creep to the bathroom in privacy to finish earlier now that my gfs asleep. I then decide to go smoke and that’s where it all goes down. I finish my cigarette and get a text asking who I’m texting so late to which I reply my boss texted me an hour ago I’m smoking. I come inside and she’s gone she now thinks I am cheating on her to which I now have to try to explain to her that I was just trying to watch porn which is even more embarrassing than it already is. So now she’s gone wherever, upset as fuck, thinking that I’m cheating on her. What in the fuck do I do?

throwaway17373955584,cac4ih,"Context:

Im in the process of selling land I inherited, it’s about 49/50 acres. I asked my lawyer Friday how much longer it’s going to take to get my deed so I can put it on the market, the wait is going to be 2 months.

I don’t come from a wealthy family and the inheritance was a surprise from my grandmother who passed over 18 years ago. My land was part of a larger property and no one told me about it, no one had any intention to either. An uncle of mine tried to take it as I was only 11 at the time and my mother (his sister) didn’t know either. That is, until a sale had to happen and everything came to light. THAT drama is another story. This is the first time in my life where maybe, just maybe, I won’t have to be a starving artist anymore.

Today:

My uncle’s girlfriend (a different uncle, let’s call him U2) is not like our family, she comes from means and owns several businesses. She likes theater and I went to an art school so we have similar interests that she doesn’t share with others in our family. Friday she invited me to see an indie play and we were talking about our usual topics of movies and plays.

So I hinted that the process is going with the land, she vaguely knows the situation with the deed, but she knows we’re it is and has been there as her bf (U2) is my neighbor. I dont live there and the land has nothing on it. I asked her if she would look at the paper work and see if she would be interested in doing some kind of business. She said yes and to send her what I have.

The next day I sent her a PowerPoint slides and I asked for a $2,000 loan to pay my bills until the deed is mine and I’d give it to her as collateral. She ghosted me. Not I’ll look at it, not “no thanks” nothing indicating she did not want to make a deal.

I gave it time to breath. I called her today and she didn’t pick up and I sent her a message and a business plan. I told her if she wasnt interested that I understand and won’t bring it up every again. Ghosted. 

She has a license to give out loans, that’s why I thought I may have been acceptable to talk about it. Banks won’t talk to me until the deed is in my hand. Also, my pay as a writer is so laughable banks definitely won’t talk to me without the property.

Im at the end of my rope, I have hardly any food in the fridge, my bills are stacking up, my remote job cut my work load and pay, I’m a week past due on my rent. All I have in the world is this land and nothing to sustain me for another 2 months before I can really change my life. Idk what to do and now I lost a friend too because I asked for a loan.

TLDR: I overstepped my boundaries and asked my uncle’s gf for a loan. Instead of saying no, she ghosted me instead and I ruined our friendship.

Update: she said yes 😭

Well as soon as I open the door two cats, one black and white and the other one was orange, run out from under my car and throught the yard. I live next to a really busy road but I am cut off because we have a line of trees blocking our view. The cats run through the trees and I can see oncoming headlights. Before I can register what happened I see the car drive by and a very loud and distinct crush like someone biting celery. I freeze for a couple of seconds with my hand over my mouth kind of staring blankly in the direction without talking. Well if you remember I was on the phone with my crush and she heard ""oh, two cats just ran out from under my car. Holy crap they are fast. Oh no. Omg. Holy shit.......""

SmugFaces,cagjnm,"My friend told me to post this. I don’t think it’s noteworthy but it’s a bit funny to me.

Today, I went to IKEA with my mom. She told me to get ice cream for my siblings and I. So, being the big sister, I waited in line while my sisters were chilling at the play room. I waited behind this girl who was supposedly texting her friend. Meanwhile, I was zoning out and thinking about other things. 5 minutes later, her friend arrives and hugs her. I glanced over due to the commotion and I see them kiss but then I made the mistake of jerking my head away after to continue zoning out. A few minutes past by when suddenly I hear “I think this weeb (I was wearing a weeaboo-ish outfit) is a homophobe”. I scoffed because I’m gay as fuck. Anyways, the last thing I heard before my inevitable death by the NSFW gods was “I think you’re right. Lily, let’s make out and make her uncomfortable.” LOW AND BEHOLD, THE GREAT WAVE OF LUSTFUL MOANS AND ASS GRABBING PORN HAD ENSUED! They made out right in front of me and all I could do was blush heavily and look away because I was uncomfortable.  It wasn’t too loud but it indeed caused quite a ruckus in my opinion. It lasted for a minute or two until it was their turn to get their ice cream. I ordered mine right after and while waiting for it, tiny GF asked me “Hey, are you homophobic?” Being a small, shy, and awkward young girl, I couldn’t get my sentence together quite right and said “uh. Uh. Hi um. No.” Big GF said “Hm? Are you sure? You kept looking away like you disliked us.” TINY GF said “Yeah, you should accept us!”

They continued to show their pride and tried to change my views.

I couldn’t clarify that I was bisexual. 

The talk lasted for about 5 minutes which caused a small crowd to surround us before I mustered enough courage to say “MY ICE CREAM IS READY” and turned around.

The ice cream was not ready and I stood there looking like a complete idiot.

Shiseidofreak,caf06x,"I met this man from a dating app. He seemed like a really hot, professional guy who is 20+ years older than I am (guessing). He was in town for work and arrived on Friday after July 4th with several colleagues to prep for a big work thing all week. He did have Saturday night free so we hooked up.

He’s able to get erections but he likes to use a viagra-type pill recreationally because he is able to last longer and multiple times with it. When I told him I wanted to edge him all night with fellatio, he said he would pop a pill to make sure he can keep up with me.

So we met Saturday late night (he wanted me to go to his hotel room after midnight because he didn’t want his co-workers seeing me enter his room). I did what I told him I would do - edged him for several hours until he finally orgasmed sometime between 4-5am this morning. But he was still erect after the orgasm and he told me sometimes that happens after popping the pill, so we didn’t make anything of it and decided to rest a little so we can go for round two and hopefully three. But a couple hours later, when I started fellatio again, he got really uncomfortable and said it was getting painful. I started to get worried because I don’t need a medical degree to know that painful penis is not normal. 

I took him to the local ER and surprisingly got triaged to see a doctor immediately. Apparently this condition can become an emergency and my “friend” was operated on by the urologist on call to drain blood from his shaft (I could be getting it wrong here). I felt really bad, but then during this ordeal when they were asking him about “legal next of kin” questions I found out he’s married with children. 

I am so scarred from this experience I’m never hooking up with a man who pops viagra type pills ever again.

TL;DR: I gave a man “priapism” which required him to undergo an operation on his penis.

Edit: The ER doctor said sometimes viagra type pills can cause “priapism” as a side effect, but it isn’t common.

Edit 2: Someone pointed out that I didn’t cause this because he would have taken the pill anyway so it is really his mistake. Thanks.",tifu,TIFU by giving a man “priapism” and ended up taking him to the hospital where the urologist on call operated on him urgently

dognass,cacjwi,"Right not sure how to go about this, but here goes...

Basically we have 1 bog in our house and sometimes thats being used.... if that is the case and im touching cloth, ill go into the garden and take a dump either in a carrier bag or bucket. Now let me add here that its risky due to my neighbour being able to catch sight of me if they decide to look over their fence...

Anyway so this fine day im struggling, my ass is sweating as im holding in what feels like a tank full of shit. Theres no choice, I go outside, get the bucket and unload. All is fine, its a relief but this shit is in that inbetween normal and runny. My ass is a mess, this is where my dog comes in...

Initially he is sniffing around and im thinking I can shoo him off... but as im in the garden, theres little chance I can go inside and have my kids catch me with my pants around my ankles, shit dripping out of my arse, just to get some toilet roll.

So for whatever reason, I bend forward, edge my ass open and let the dog clear the shit for me :o

Im there bent over, its not sexual, just a mutual dog likes shit, i need a clean (or cleaner backside) situation. However this is the FU part, as im there bent over, ass cheeks spread with my hands earning their wage... the neighbour looks over. I just stare back, dont move, what can you do in all honesty.

Our eyes meet, she disappears, in haste I realise whats happened, pull up the pants and try to salvage my dignity by going inside and making a cup of tea.

Luckily nothing has come of it since, but im sure there are questions to be answered. I needed to get this off my chest... it hasnt happened again and never will. Desperate times called for desperate measures and this one just went a bit wrong.

MySonLovesThisGame,cadgcr,"This isn’t a long one and happened a while back when I was 17.

I had very recently broken into a new friend group (who all knew each other very well) hoping to get close to one girl in particular in it. We went to dinner as a group of about five and I sat with another girl sitting in between myself my crush. The crush, who we’ll call L, was incredibly out of my league and I knew my best chance at getting a date with her would be by making her laugh. I spent the majority of the dinner trying to make even the smallest things funny, and to my surprise it was actually working. At one point the girl in between us took out her phone and I saw her background was a photo of a man in a graduation cap. I assumed this was her dad and went on to make fun of her, asking why she has a photo of just her dad as her background and pointing out how surely her mother must get jealous. Looking back, there was absolutely no reaction, but thinking I’d struck comedy gold I just kept going, joking about how the photo was clearly old and she should’ve at least picked a newer one, or how she should’ve put her boyfriend as her background who was sitting across from us at the table. 

The table went silent, and you can all see where this is going. My crush began to hug and caress the girl and I quickly realised something was wrong. For the first time in my life I found hoping that her parents were just divorced, but later when E and I were alone she told me the girl’s father had passed away a few years prior.

I felt sick knowing that the girl was so kind and gentle and that I’d completely bottled the dinner. What’s worse is that she didn’t say a single thing about it and very courageously decided not to expose her past and how stupid I was.

On the plus side, we’re still friends. And on the plus plus side, I’ve been going out with L for 9 months now.

anonymBird,cai1no,"Happened 12hous ago.

Backstory: My parents moved from Turkey to Germany when they were young. So some people say I'm German, some say I'm Turkish (I personally don't care).

Now there is my girlfriends mom, let's call her Eva, a super Christian woman living her whole life in a valley. And I mean like going to church at least once a week and praying before she eats.
You don't see this level of religiousness often here. 
She is also very afraid of looking like a Rassist, which she is absolutely not. But you know, just behaving awkward by trying not to offend me.

My family is like every other German family, they don't even care about culture. But Eva, never met them and seems to assume that we are some cliche Muslim family with woman's wearing Hijab and stuff. Even tho  we have been through some Deep talk about how I don't believe in God and my family is not religious.

Now it's my dad's birthday and my girlfriend (24, let's call her Maria) visits my father's family (my parents are separated) for the first time. And Eva is always so overwhelmingly worried about maria and she keeps texting us both how things are going. 

On our way home I jokingly answer: ""everything is fine, Maria loved our culture and traditions so much she wants to convert to islam.""

She responses with a longer text about how she is not racist and tolerant and stuff but if her daughter converts she couldn't handle it.
I'm like ""oh don't worry, it's nothing about you"".
She: ""but she's my daughter.""
And I: ""yes, you should support her in her choices""

She stopped texting, saying it makes her sick. Now she thinks i hate her.

Ok so it was around 11 am when I met with this friend and we made the ""firecracker"". The thing is I have never gotten high before I smoked like two three times and it never worked. And we also had no clue as to how much to put in the cracker so we just like put 500mg of weed in each. We eat it and about 40mins later we feel pretty giggly now I don't know what the fuck went through out mind but thought it was the good moment to go get lunch as out shit was starting. We get lunch and are absolutely UNABLE to eat as the laughing was so intense it almost hurt. I started getting tunnel vision and hearing weirdly we had to get out of the store and at this point it was way to intense for me to handle I thought this was it Im gonna die. Though thank God we arrived at his place safe after crowling (littarly) in the street. Then we had the courage to sit on the couch where it got even more intense. First effects were a sort of weird breathing falling thing. Like I was falling and getting back to the top as I was breathing (very slowly) that s also when I remembered I had to be home to get family dinner with family at 7 (I m 15) That s where ot got even more horrible my mouse got so fucking dry and basically instead of seeing normal shit when I, closed my eyes, I was seeing my self in a red very sticky mouse part of a skull. This freaked the shit out of me I couldn't keep my eyes open too long but I had to though... Then thank Gid after like 4 hours it started melting down with only waves of high up until now. My parents did not point out my red eyes, and I managed not to talk during the dinner except to say something about the serie ""Nathan for you"" which sounded like shit as I was high but the show is great so I managed to keep it consistent.

mrminesheeps,ca99ex,"So this happened today, believe it or not. I... Need someplace to vent. TL;DR at the bottom, for those who want to find out about my sorrows the easy way. 
So, me and Sarah (the fake-name I'm giving for her) have been in a relationship for a few years now. About, say, two and a half years. We had a really strong relationship. But her parents went through a divorce, which I helped her through. The struggles she was living with for so long. She told me, she doesn't know where she'd be if it wasn't for me. But eventually, she had to move with her mom to Ohio. This is where things started going South, unbeknownst to me. She started texting me less. For context, she had an ex-bf she used to talk to. She began talking to him again sometime after she moved. At first, it was as friends. But somehow, Douchebag (the name of that ex-bf) had managed to wrench her from me. She slowly began to love him again. And for some reason, she kept it going. As far as I was aware, we were still as close as ever. But I found it strange that she wasn't responding to me as often. We eventually planned for me to visit her for 4 weeks over the summer. And two weeks ago by this coming Monday, I arrived at her house. I could tell something was off. I'd had suspicions of something between those two. As the days went on, this started seeming more evident. But I was certain it was nothing. But come today, I had woke up early in the morning, and I went to go sleep somewhat close to where she was in her room. I woke up a few hours later, she was still asleep. I saw her phone. Knowing me, I felt like it'd be funny if I messed with it a bit. So I had my grand scheme in mind. I log into her phone, just to discover her Discord open. And what I saw on her messages felt like I was stabbed in the heart. I saw her latest messages to Douchebag. And instinctively, I kept scrolling. My heart hurt more and more. My beliefs about her had begun crumbling. And then I found it. A message of her calling herself his gf. That did it for me. My happiness, snapped like a damn twig under a semi truck. And the messages were like each individual wheel rolling over that twig twofold. I threw her phone down onto her bed, wrote a message for her on paper, saying I've seen her messages. I had, at this point, already wrote a long message asking her what the hell she did that for. I wanted to talk to her. What ended up happening, eventually, no matter what I said, was that she no longer had the same feelings. That's it. And worse yet, I'm stuck here for another two weeks. She had lots of friends. Close friends. All of which held close friendships and honesty dearly. They'll find out soon. I can't keep my mouth shut forever. They'll know. And when they do, they'll likely hate her. I don't want that, I still love her. But it's inevitable. She feels really bad for it, and she knows what she did is wrong. I want to forgive her, but I can't seem to muster the strength to do so. My heart is pounding just by typing this. It's like I'm reliving my worst nightmare. She's pretty much made it clear where we stand. She wanted to end it on her own terms, but here we are. She wanted to still be friends. I want that, but I'm certain my emotions won't allow it. It feels good venting. But I'm not going to have a good time for these last two weeks. Its not like I can cut the trip early. My round trip was called to be four weeks. I don't think I can keep myself together here much longer. I'll go ahead and write the TL;DR, and get off Reddit for now. I need to think. 

TL;DR I had a strong relationship, for over two and a half years, and it all came crashing down when I discovered her side boyfriend, Senior Douchebag.

Edit: I've contacted parents, I have a ticket to leave out tomorrow afternoon. Thanks for the support from those who did. As for her, she's pretty much been crying all day. She hates what she's done. I told her that if things don't work out with them, I'm still here. But she's not going to have that trust handed to her. She'll have to work for it if she wants it.

kaylacactus,caa936,"Actually did just happen a couple minutes ago. 

I decided to put “kitty caps” on my kittens nails, because she’s been scratching the shit out of everyone/everything lately. (Yes clipping her nails and buying scratching posts aren’t working 100% of the time yet) I had some time to kill so I figured why not. 

My cat obviously doesn’t like having them put on her because I have to hold her still for a couple minutes at a time, so after getting a few on I decided to take a break. They do just stick on with super glue that comes with a little tube to put the glue in the caps. 

Here leads to the fuck up.. I come back maybe 15 minutes later and decide to resume. But apparently the glue had gotten stuck at the top of the applicator and hardened. I decided to keep pushing glue out and hoping that it would just pop the hard piece out, nope, it didn’t. Immediately after I decide “well I may as well bite it off” so I did, the moment I put my teeth on it the hardened glue comes out and the rest of the glue I had pushed to the top goes flowing into my mouth. I can’t just spit it out. I try to avoid touching my tongue to other parts in my mouth while I run to my bathroom and start scrubbing. 

I got like all of it off my tongue but there’s still a lot I can feel on my teeth, I tried brushing them with super hot water and just scraping the glue off but it’s not budging. Should be a fun few days while I wait for it to wear off. Now in hindsight, I should’ve just fucking cut the tip of the glue off in the first place. 

TL;DR: bit the tip of a super glue applicator, glue leaked into my mouth and now it’s stuck on my teeth and mildly uncomfortable for a few days.

It’s somehow on par with shock collars and declawing?? Oh my god cry me a river. Please show me where or how glue on her nails is going to hurt her. 

I rescued her from a cockroach infested house after being abandoned at 4 weeks old. What, I should’ve just left her there due to the fact that I.. put glue on her nails? Lmao.

FrizzMissile,caf9zg,"Sometime last night my dad popped an Ambien and at some later point, got in his car and went on a drive. He ended up rolling his car over the side of the road, was taken to the hospital, and later arrested and taken to jail for driving while intoxicated.

I got a call from him around 11am and began taking care of things for him. I checked on his dogs, closed up his house, and called my stepmom (mine and my stepmom’s phone number are the only ones he could remember and stepmom only looks at her phone once or twice a day so he got a hold of me first). He also asked me to have a family friend contact another guy to take over a meeting for him. So I do.

Guy #1 (family friend) is in AA. My dad is in AA. I spoke at his 20 year chip ceremony last year. I believe my dad’s version of events, but I also know it’s possible he was drinking, and may need his own time to tell his loved ones. So I tell Guy #1 that he’s ok but in the hospital. He asked which one and I said ‘he’s in town X’ and he said ‘ok, probably at hospital Y’. Guy # 1 calls Guy #2 (meeting guy) and that’s that.

An hour later I get a call from Guy #3, who is also in AA. ‘Is Dad ok? He’s not in hospital Y.’ Guy #3 happened to be there at the emergency room and says the staff told him he’s not a patient.

Then, it dawned on me. You tell your friends when your other friend is in the hospital. You don’t tell your friends when your friend is in jail for a DWI after decades in AA. I told Guy #3 the truth because I am a terrible liar.

Dad is a very open and honest person, and he didn’t ask me to lie. I did it to give him privacy and to let him tell his story at his own pace during a stressful time. But I ended up tipping the first domino in his AA tree, which is massive, as it is a big part of his life.

I tell Guy #1 the full story. I tell Dad and he is just happy for the help and feeling guilty over his mistake. First and foremost, I feel happy Dad’s ok. I also feel super, super dumb for thinking I was clever enough to maintain a lie for more than an hour and for inadvertently alerting his entire AA network that he’s in jail.

polojet,cao44p,"I'm somewhat of a prude when it comes to being open about anything remotely sexual with my family. It's just something we never did growing up so it's always been that awkward thing we knew not to speak of...until last night. 

For a bit of backstory, I had been talking to this girl I met  about a month ago, we went on 2 dates and just really clicked, she was quite open about eventually getting sexual but the timing didn't quite work out as I was scheduled in for a major operation (so no action for a little white until I recovered). Well 2 weeks pass and my recovery is going really well, I'm still not quite 100% at this point, but my spirits are high as I'm getting better everyday. Because of this, the priest at my local church also asked if he could visit to check up on how I've been doing to which I agree. 

Anyways this visit happened 2 nights ago and it happened to coincide with my parents going away for the weekend which almost never happens...I had the house to myself. Thinking to myself, an opportunity like this would never come again for a long, long time - I had to seize this opportunity. So naturally, I invite said friend over. We hang out in the living room and watch The Edge of Seventeen before one thing leads to another. I go to my secret draw and pull out my pack of rubber and slide it down my totem pole and we do the deed right there in the living room. After this ""intermission"" we go back to finishing another of Hailee Steinfeld's stellar performances  and we say our goodbyes. 

I now quickly freshen the house up a bit to expel any indication of what I had just done as the priest from my local church is due to visit in a few hours. And this is where I messed up. Hours pass and I hear a knock at the door at around 7:30 as promised. I hop up off the couch I had been laying on, open the door and usher my esteemed guest into the living room and eventually to the one condom wrapper that lay open in the middle of my couch. My jaw drops and I quickly turn bright red before snatching it off the cushion and into my pocket. But it was too late, the damage had been done. The priest had seen what he thought he saw. 

TL;DR - Invited a girl over and did more than just the tango, did a poor job tidying up after myself and left an open condom wrapper on the couch for my local priest to find. Had to apologize to not one, but two Fathers. I'm sorry Father Williams.",tifu,TIFU by forgetting to dispose the condom wrapper
IamcatMeowMeow,caeejc,"So yes, this wasn't today, but was about 3 weeks ago. After coming to terms with the missed opportunity I thought some of you here might get a kick out of the story. Here we go.

I travel a lot for work. Not just day trips, overnights, which means lots of hotels. I've often thought about hooking up when I'm staying in one, but I'm very socially awkward so I'm not good at flirting or one night stands kinda thing. My friends say I am good looking (the honest types who would call you a pig if you weren't) but I don't have the confidence.

Anyway. On one of these trips I'd finished work for the day and was down at the hotel bar, surprisingly not that busy as was in a big city as opposed to a rural trip. After a while I notice a hot woman walk in. I find myself staring at her more than I should to a total stranger, but then I realise why. She's a porn star I recognise. And one I very frequently...watch. I wasn't certain from the face but could tell by the distinctive tattoos.

She's alone and gets a drink, and I guess I must have still been staring even though I tried not to, as we made eye contact. I went to look away but she smiled, so I smiled back, and to my shock she walked over. I won't bore you with the details of the whole conversation, but it went really well. We made initial small talk about inconvenient parking outside and then moved on to actually chatting. She told me her name (her real one) and told me about her dogs, leaning over showing me pictures, her hand on my shoulder, stuff like that. More shockingly, I didn't ruin the conversation. I didn't inappropriately mention I recognised her and actually made her laugh quite a bit, it was going really good.

So after about an hour and a half she starts motioning to get up, getting her bags together, and says she should head up to her room soon. I say ok. She says her room would be more comfortable than the bar to unwind in, I laugh and say yeah probably. She still doesn't leave yet, but after a while stands up, twirling the room key swipe card on her finger (147, still remember it) and says ""This has been fun, hopefully I'll see you again, soon"" to which I respond...

""Yes nice meeting you too, goodnight!"" Then go back to my beer, feeling ever so pleased with myself for totally having an good conversation. She pauses, then heads off.

It wasn't until I told friends about it a week or so later they pointed out that, she was actually most likely flirting with me and the twiddling the room key while standing waiting for me may well have been an invitation to join her. Being a social retard, I had no idea and just assumed she was tired.

TL:DR Could have gone to bed with a super hot porn star, instead sent her to bed alone.

Edit: Wow this post really took off. I'm glad you could share in my misery lol. I just wanted to respond to people asking her identity, thought it would be easier to put it here instead answering one by one. Even though I did tell my (guy) friends who she was, something about putting her name here publicly just feels...wrong. Even though my initial reaction seeing her was ""omg it's *porn name*"" my conversation and experience was with the real person behind that. As you can see here, not all comments are positive with things varying from slut shaming to suggesting she must have STDs if she does porn. I'm sure she's a tough cookie and can handle it, but she must get enough of that stuff from what she does for work. I'd rather not contribute to it in her personal life too.

reddesttwp,caig59,"This unfortunately happened yesterday night and I really really want to die right now.

I go to high school in hk and theres like a low key tradition between students especially seniors to go on a full grade trip after graduation, and come back to party back here as a grade. The biggest fuck up happened at the party. I shared a comp sci class with this senior girl called M and we got along well leading to texting flirting and eventually to me asking her out. She refused tho as our age gap was huge (for highschool) and she was graduating soon. However we stayed friends. 
Now i dont know about normal people but i fall in love quick as fuck and deep as fuck. I literally plan a marriage before even asking a girl out and she was one of the few i did ask out. so it stayed with me for a while. anyway back from the vacation M invites me to the party in LK (Lan kwai fung a club street kinda thing) and i decide to go with a few friends to drink and hang out. 
Ive never drank with her before so me thinking if i look strong and old to handle large amounts of liquor i may have a chance again decide to take 27 (bit watered down) shots. I unfortunately dont pass out but get drunk as shit, and what do i do first? 
In front of everyone (ALL SENIORS, and a lot of juniors, freshmen) I decide to fucking get down on my knees and ask her to “take me with her” and to “start a life together.” 
she just gives me a WTF look and everyone films and cringes. my few friends who werent filming the thing takes me outside and sends me home.
If this wasnt bad enough the video went around school, eventually reaching a teacher who sees me in a club and i get suspended.

Please give me unpainful ways to die

Andrew_Trinh,caoezr," Today I accidentally hit a zombie pigman in the nether when I went down there to find some fortresses. That pigman called his buddies over to kill me and jesus christ there were like 20 of them chasing me, eventually killed me. When I got back to collect my dropped items, they continued to chase me, eventually came through the nether portal back to the overworld. Unfortunately, my base which contains my bed (the spawn point in this game) was very close to the portal so there were like around 15 of them came into my hut and these assholes just stayed there to kill me when I just respawned. Everytime I respawned, I was only able to hit them with the character's bare hand which dealt very limited damage. I managed to kill all of them..... after 40 or more respawns at my very own base.

IEnumerable661,caihlf," 

So a little back story. Before this all happened, my girlfriend and I have had a few minor incidents of running into some odd people. There was one particular incident where some weirdos at a pub were very much ""into us"" if you know what I mean and got a little too insulting at another point. We left shortly afterwards, but it did inaugurate a sense of ""Why do we attract weird people?""

So I had a couple of tickets for Rammstein this Saturday just gone. It's my girl's first big rock/metal gig with fire and flames and the like. So obviously I was keen that she would enjoy the experience. There wasn't quite sufficient time to get her very acquainted though a few songs she knew anyway. Plus it's Rammstein, they're pretty good at being a very accessible metal band.

We were outside queuing at one of the many temporary beer tents when this excitable German gentleman happened to be near us. He said a line of a Rammstein song, which I duly followed up with (I think it was Du Hast). He seemed pleased with the response and noticing my girl didn't quite get it, I presume he thought she didn't know the German lyrics. Opting to go easy, he said to her, ""You have a pussy!"" Looking confused, she nodded accepting that this was indeed the case. ""I have a dick-a""... more confusion, ""Yesss...."" came the response. At this point I decided to intervene and explain that she hadn't heard the track. The German guy did look a little red faced, realising the potential awkwardness of the situation.

As you can imagine, this awkward interchange took a little explaining. We in fact did not run into another odd person, just an excited Rammstein fan keen to share his lyrical knowledge. I can only imagine what she must have been thinking during this exchange. Thankfully, Rammstein did indeed play Pussy during their set so I think that explained it. It made me chuckle inside a little. I think German guy finished his exchange with us, saving a little embarrassment with a little exchange of Du Reicht So Gut (which it turns out means You Smell So Good... I guess that's an odd thing to say to a stranger in and of itself too haha but I started it so...)

It was a great show though, she really enjoyed herself and it was sweet as it was our first gig together of that ilk, that is past the local music scene.

HnyuQ_,cai6ve,"I was just thinking about this and thought I should share and see your guys experience/opinion.

Back when I was in highschool, I smoked cigarette almost everyday. Around senior year, I got introduced to weed. And man. Was it awesome. I smoked it out of a bong and whoosh. Exactly what you imagine getting high would feel like. For those of you who have never been high, imagine working out SUPER hard. And you know that feeling you get the next day? Super sore and your limbs feel like jello? Imagine that but absolutely no pain + your mind is wondering.

Anyways since that time, I started to smoke weed whenever I had the chance. Mostly from friends, they were nice enough to share. Most of the stuff I had were joints and pipes. So I never got that high from the first time but it's ok.

Then came the day of the fuck up:
Friends wanted to go to the beach. Typical drinks/food. And of course our weed guy was going to be there. He said he just bought some awesome new shit that we had to try. But that same day I had promise my parents and aunt that I would be designated driver for them for dinner (they wanted to go to an izakaya). I somehow convinced myself that I would be able to go to the beach in the morning, get a little high, then drive back for my family.

So here I am, at the beach. My friends are taking shots but because I drove I said nah. And just smoked some weed from a pipe. I'll be honest, I wasn't really getting that high. So I think I smoked from the pipe about 6 or 7 times. I'm like eh I guess today I'm not feeling it. I can still hang.

Then the weed guy comes and he goes ""We gotta try new shirt out"". I'm like alright let's goo. 

If you guys don't already see the problem I'll list them out.

1. I haven't eaten. I thought I would be eating with my family. We were about to smoke from a fat bong
2. I had already had like 6 hits from a pipe.
3. At a beach with people who I was not super close. Like we hungout before but we aren't close at all 
4. Let's be honest. I was in HIGHSCHOOL. I knew nothing on the effects of weed and I had no idea it is temporary and almost impossible to OD.

So I take a hit. And oh god... I literally felt the world land on top of me. I legitimately flopped backwards from how powerful that hit was. I sat back up only to realize that I started to see double. Maybe not even double, imagine that screen you see after [you win a game of solitaire](https://youtu.be/_hNwHdzRKXE). That was how I was seeing EVERYTHING. I see this shit and my first thought was. Oh no. I OD'ed. I'm literally feeling paranoid and I go ""hey... Guys I think... brain... Broke"" I hear them laugh which I didn't understand. I got mad, so I'm go ""I'm not... Joking... fucking... Scared..."" In my head my sentences were in perfect order, but I knew no one understood me. I knew this because I couldn't understand THEM. I'm literally just focusing on not trying to die. I start screaming like ""HELP NO I BROKE... OH MY GOD. YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW..."" Usually weed makes me feel so sleepy and lazy. But this time I was so high my brain was on overload. Because of this, I'm freaking out. I can't stop overthinking and I felt like I broke the fabric of time. I asked them for the time and I began counting the seconds to a minute. It was not till years later I realized I was counting OUTLOUD. So everyone was just watching me go ""1... 2... 3... 4..."". I felt like I had died and somehow, by smoking this bong, I had unleash the pathway to hell and I am now forever stuck in this everlasting cyclone of images and thoughts. I am just thinking how I REALLY regretted this and how I did not want this feeling to stay. I want to say this my first experience with a panic attack so at the time I thought I was going to die.

I tell the guys ""hey... I want to go home... But... My brain broke... Drive?"" and luckily a girl (who is now my best friend) offered to drive. Lemme tell you. I was thinking in like 80 thoughts per second. I thought ""this is how I will die... A fucking virgin..."" I start to think I should try to fuck one of the guys here before I completely die. Luckily I didn't do that. I also thought if somehow I survive this episode, I will devote my entire life to spreading awareness in the HORRORS of marijuana. I wouldn drop out of college and just become those people. My next thoughts were to try to get unhigh. I realize if I move my arms in a certain pattern. The high kind of goes away. As you can imagine, [this was how I looked](https://youtu.be/fKqaOWSQKE4). I get to the car miraculously and I tell the girl ""please... Take my to the doctor"" she laughs and said nah you need food! She ends up taking me to McDonald's and I'm like ""where's my phone?"" she passes it to me and to my HORROR. I had missed the dinner COMPLETELY. Apparently she had texted them that I got food poisoning to my family and told them to go without me. At the time I was like I'M DEAD. I'm thinking I want to cry. But I was so high I forgot how to. I was thinking I can cry by opening my mouth and saying ""Cry... Cry for me"".

When I got home I threw up in my car and just dropped dead in front of my parents house. I remember just laying there in my vomit as my friend told my mom (they got home from dinner) that I got really bad food poisoning. My mom then helped me into the shower. Which AT THAT TIME. I somehow got out of my high state. I thought PRAISE JESUS OUR HEAVENLY GOD. And I crawled into bed thinking what a crazy trip.

The next day my mom told me she bought me medicine for my stomach and that she cleaned my car. I felt so shitty cuz I knew she knew. I apologized to her but she said it's ok, just don't eat mussels anymore. 

TL;DR
Thought I could go to the beach and get high and still make it to a family dinner, but miscalculated the potency of marijuana and got paranoid and missed out on a nice evening:/",tifu,TIFU by flaking on my family dinner because I got so high I was sure I had broken my brain
iExtrordinary,cahorh,"As I'm laying here in bed at almost 3am I reminded myself of my absolutely shitty fuck up that happened earlier in the day..

Today myself and my family went out to the beach to go swimming. My brother and I start drinking a few beers and decide to get in the water for a swim and long before you know it I've got a decent buzz going.

My brother starts to walk out of the water so what do I do? I start giggling like the child at heart I am at the thought of throwing a little rock from pretty far back in the water at my brother who is walking out of the water into the sand.

Here's where the fuck up happens, I pick up this rock that's about the size of a half dollar or so and launch it into the air to try and hit my brother in the back with it.. well if you remember I've got that decent buzz going on and that rock was never going to hit my brother with the aim I had. 

The rock goes completely opposite of where I wanted it to go and it hits directly in the back of my 1&amp;1/2 year old daughter who's sitting on my fiance's lap.. and she starts screaming and I start getting absolutely torn into from not only my fiance but my mom as well. 

What could make this worse you say? - as my mom is yelling at me for hitting her with a rock on accident making sure she said ""you hit your child with a rock, this is why I don't like you drinking out here"" about as loud as she possibly could.. the entire land of beachgoers can hear this happening and are staring at me..  

I am absolutely embarrassed at this point and don't want to get out of the water.

Tldr - got buzzed off beer, tried hitting my brother in the back with a rock and totally missed and hit my daughter in the back which lead to absolute embarrassment from everyone there at the beach.

derpyofthegods,caoesd,"This actually happened today, typing this out as I'm waiting for the situation to unfold. LTL FTP Yada Yada, mobile, etc. 

So let's set the stage here. Today I wake up bright and early, ready to start my first day on the job as an intern for a company. As a college student, this is a huge opportunity and I'm excited to get experience in the field I want to be my career. 

I live with a roommate, let's call her Cheryl, and another guy used to live in the apartment, let's call him Mike. Mike still had a set of keys because he technically wasn't moving out until the end of the week, so I was told by Cheryl to get his keys at work today. 

Now Cheryl has to go to work earlier than me, so she gives me her keys and says ""lock up when you leave."" So I do just that. I get to work and start with all the orientation paperwork and stuff like that, you know, all the first day on the job type things. We take a break around 9:30 or so and I go find Mike and ask him for his keys to the apartment, which he graciously gives me. In turn, I put those on my Keychain for my car so that I can't lose them, right?

Around 11:45, after more safety meetings and orientation, we break for lunch (1 hour) and I think, ""hey. My apartment is only 15 minutes away, let me go back and make lunch so I can save money."" Plenty of time to be back by 12:45. 

I arrive back, let myself in, and make myself a bomb-ass sandwich with some other snacky foods. Cheryl is a little concerned and calls me because her orientation didn't take as long as mine so she wanted to make sure everything was going well. I informed her that it was and I would be working by the end of the day, but orientation was going long. Then the FU occurs. 

As I'm leaving, I decide to lock the doors using the inside knob thingy instead of using my keys, because I wouldn't have to worry about not locking it correctly or something like that. I don't know, it made sense in my head. I close the apartment door and the outside door and I'm walking to my car when I reach in my pocket and realize that my keys aren't there. 

Fuck. 

I sprint back up the stairs and try the door because that totally makes sense and lo and behold, the door is locked. Assessing the situation, I call Cheryl and ask her if there is a third set of keys. She doesn't know, goes and calls our landlady and finds out that there is! Wahoo! But it's a 30 minute drive away and I still don't have car keys. So now she has to leave her job, get the keys, bring them to me, so I can get mine, drive back for orientation, and maybe, just maybe preserve my professional reputation that I'm trying to build. 

Rip me. 

TL;DR I locked my car and 2 sets of apartment keys in my apartment on the fist day of work during lunch hour. Now my roommate has to drive 30 minutes to get me the spare keys so I can go back to work.",tifu,TIFU by locking my keys in my aprtment
No_428,caoawu,"So this happened a few hours ago and still reeling from it, if quitting and getting a job was easy I would.

These posts always start with a little bit of background: So a lot of people see me as this super sweet, church going virgin whose happily single. Not a lot of people who I work with know me beyond work and I prefer that. So I work in a primary school and it's a small school so everyone is well informed of each others personal lives and rumors spread quickly around the school. In my block there are four male teachers and one other female teacher and I interact with all of them regularly at school and am grade partners with the male teacher next to me. 

Today there was training at school and during tea time I been chatting to my grade partner when one of the other male teachers from our block came over talking and laughing about things I don't really care about but because I am sweet and have personality I do engage when people chat to me. 

So the conversation was the basics how were the holidays did you rest? Then being back at work was and how much it sucks so Mr Third Wheel brought up how being an adult sucks. It was then I remembered a meme I had seen earlier that morning related to that and laughed out loud saying that I had seen this super funny meme that he would love on reddit. Let me find it you. 

So stupid old me took out her phone, well aware that two pairs of eyes could see my screen as I am very short, my browser was already open to the Google page of Toy Story 2 and in my sleep deprived auto pilot didn't think twice about the fact that incognito mode was on that was normal (I google a film rather than watch it). My profile name was on screen for a second the fact that it was my alternative didn't click in because I had many throwaway accounts I used every now and again and barely remembered what I would post on them. It wasn't until I clicked my home page and all these red NSFW warnings were on my screen and the first blurred subreddit: r/biggerthanyouthought that my gut fell into my shoes and bolted because it was my throwaway porn account and if I had seen it they had.

leno95,caimhw,"Obligatory this happened yesterday.

I'm on holiday in Icmeler, Turkey, and behind the hotel I'm staying at is a mountain, fairly rugged, but easily climbable. My parents, myself and my two brothers left at 5:30am to climb it, hoping to be back before breakfast finished at the hotel, which was 11am. We brought maybe 6L of water, which we thought would be enough for 5 people for 3-4 hours. 

It went awry when we got 2/3rds of the way up, when the path diverged, one continued going up, which appeared too treacherous (we're not climbers or mountaineers, if anything it was mostly a rocky uphill trek), and the other began to take us down the mountain into a small ravine between the mountain we were on and the other adjacent to it.

We wandered down the route to a small waterfall which had dried out, the ravine was typically dry in the summer, and during winter it'd be flowing with water, so it was filled with large rocks and boulders coated with salt and other minerals brought down the mountain. We clambered down  the waterfall, and after doing so, we realised that we had just climbed a good 15m or so down a near vertical drop.

Following this, we realised that we had heavily fucked up, as we couldn't climb back up. We then tried to follow the ravine, as it flows into the storm drains which are throughout the town. 45 minutes of clambering down and up rocks followed, and we ended up in a canyon. We couldn't turn back, as we weren't experienced enough at rock climbing to climb back up to the waterfall. 

Ahead of us laid a 10m vertical drop, with no handholds we could find to climb down. The left-side cliff face was a 240m high vertical climb, which was out of the question to attempt. The right-side was a 45 degree incline, however it was littered with large rocks which shifted when we attempted to climb it, which did little to inspire us with hope.

At 12pm we called for help, luckily we had my grandmother and girlfriend still at the hotel as they weren't particularly well enough to do long walks, especially up a mountain. They informed the hotel who requested search and rescue. We had almost no shade, and we also had run out of water. At 3pm mountain rescue finally got to us, and the way they climbed up the rocks reminded me almost of Gollum up the staircase to Shelob's cave. With their help, we climbed 200m on the right-hand side, and scrambled between cliff edges and thick tree coverage, all whilst severely dehydrated and suffering from heat stroke.

The kicker came when we found the dried up waterfall we climbed down, as the road they had came from wasn't even a 20 minute walk uphill from opposite the waterfall. At 6:30pm we had managed to get to the road and to their car, where we were given additional water, health checkups and then were returned to the hotel, where police were awaiting to ensure we weren't lured up the mountain by shady tourist guides.

As I'm going around the rink I see the back of who I think is a guy but as I role past there face seemed feminine, guys or girls I don't mind but I soon found out that this was a young woman and she seemed to be not much older than me. She wore black jeans, a black My Chemical Romance shirt, a black beanie and died black hair. She was thin but she skated ok. 

I had several opportunities to have a conversation with her, to ask her name, to do anything except overthink, panic and try really hard not to make eye contact despite the encouragement of my friends, I still didn't!

So at the time I was seeing a girl with whom I had a fairly active sex life (RIP my sex life) and we decided to take a shower one day. We were just messing around and reptile brain over here decided it would be fun to put soap on her chest because soap + boobs is a great combo. So I grabbed a bottle of liquid castille soap (you know the kind that lasts ten years) and we were having a great time.

Until the burning sensation started up. It was hardcore peppermint liquid soap and that shit stings like a motherfucker. I basically spearmint-fresh-nuked her nipples. I spent the next while after that trying to make up for it but you can’t really be mentholate somebody’s nipples instanly.

runetoonxx2,cafnak,"This happened at 3am EST today.

Background Info:
Recently my friends and I went on a trip to Pennsylvania. We went to a waterpark and it was very fun lol. On the way back we decided it would be funny to go into a sex shop. One of my female friends decided it would be funny to get me (a male) a vibrator (this comes in relevant later). So the day goes by and I just go to my room and sleep. I put EVERYTHING in my pocket to charge and just pass out (including the vibrator).

Note: leaving a vibrator charging for long periods of time apparently makes the vibrator turn on randomly.

Now to the present: (The fk up)
So I woke in the middle of the night cause I was thirsty. Went down to get a drink of water. Then all of a sudden I just hear a loud rumbling. Sounded like a god dam earthquake. Woke up everyone in my house. Run upstairs to check what's going on. Parents and siblings freaking out cause they think someone broke in..... Then I see my vibrator.... which has been charging for 3 days... randomly turned on and vibrating on the floor. So I ran to it quickly turned it off and hid it. I managed to convince them that it was nothing and we all went to sleep.

tl:dr 
friend bought me a vibrator that I left charging for several days. It randomly turned on in the middle of the night scaring my entire family. Convinced them nothing was in my room and now they think ghosts exist.

This lead to me being late (it was harder than expected to find equipment). In a panic, I smashed my bag down, forgetting the loose bottle in my bag.

So I’m a pretty clean person, but my room has gotten a little cluttered over the years, but today I decided to tidy up a bit, throw away a few old files etc. I went over to my “medal shelve” as I like to call it to dust my medals. A brown recluse decided “Oh! I’ll hatch my demon spawn here!” You probably already know what I’m gunna write. So as I was tidying up one of my “neck ribbons (?)” and as I grabbed it, I felt something soft. I look down and there’s a fucking spider egg in my hands, I go and flush that shit down the toilet. I go back to finish (why didn’t I stop? Why did I go back? Why did I not figure out that there might be a spider who laid that egg sack?) and this big ass brown recluse crawls on my hand. It was in that “imma bite ur ass” position, I rush to the bathroom and flush that shit in the toilet too! I was too traumatized to go back to that shelf. 


Just imagine if that egg sack hatched? I would’ve had a much bigger or on my hands. What if my cat found that spider before me? I would’ve probably found my cat dead. I’m just happy I found it when I did. I’m 99.99% sure the egg sack hasn’t hatched.

One of the things he sent me was of the guy who treated him like shit and ghosted him (I’ll get to this later) he buttered me up telling me things about how hot I was and stuff and I sent stuff back, eventually he just hit me with the dick pic and lots of videos, he asked and asked for a day for one back, me being an fucking idiot sent one back... this is where the shit begins, HE DIDNT SCREENSHOT IT so I thought I was in the clear, we talked a lot about our fantasies and had fun, then I sent some videos to him, he basically consumed my life, it was unhealthy and I knew it, every couple hours he would say some strange things though that didn’t match up, anyway from the videos I sent he replayed the first one which I didn’t find weird and then (presumably recorded them (?) ) I’m not sure on that one though but he didn’t replay any of the others. Anyway forward yesterday, this whole thing was over 3 days, so last night I said goodnight he said he had to go to the church, whatever didn’t think anything of it, then I woke up this morning and he sent me a message (not exactly word for word) “my parents found our chats and they going to make me block you I’m sorry I don’t fucking know why” so I was devastated and wasn’t convinced and only KNOW was getting really sus, and started to spiral and connect all the things he said and the loops in the story, to this day I don’t know if he’s a cat fish or legit and just saving everyone’s photos and videos. I went to his reddit and messaged him then decided to check his profile only 15 minutes ago and found WHILST I HAD BEEN TALKING TO HIM, he had been commenting on r/hotguys and r/cuteguys and telling them their hot and I believe 3 days ago just after we swapped to snap he posted a post on r/rightwinglgbt about how he was a college age student when he told me, and so does he profile that he’s a lot younger like at least 3 years, WTF.  He did talk about his love for trump and I was confused as he was bi and let’s be honest he hasn’t been the best to the lgbt community, that was my first red flag which I idiotically ignored. Anyway I’m just so mad at him and hate this so much, we also recently lost our best friend on Snapchat which means we’re not talking to each other the most and that was the second major red flag, by this time I hadn’t sent any more of anything, and that was when I checked reddit and I was considering going onto all of his comments and saying he was a fucking dick head, but I stopped myself to come here for advice, I won’t expose him yet but I was so god damn close because I would hate it to happen to another person, the thing is that he FaceTimed me on Snapchat and I could see him moving around so I don’t believe it was cat fishing if it was it was very advanced as well as the MULTIPLE photos and videos of him. Anyway hope you guys can help ease my pain, it really hurts. Thank you

wgrz,caizfb,"I sat down in Boeing 777 in Denver for flight to London. A flight I'd done 2 times previously.  I'm a bad flyer, so if flight is over 2 hours, it's better for everyone that I'm drugged. Sooo... Board group 1, find seat and pop newish nighttime meds at ""sleep is definitely insured"" dosage: 10mg Ambien and 10mg diazepam.  2 seats next to me are empty! I'm comfy and out cold before plane leaves tarmac...

Suddenly, flight attendant is waking me up.  10ish hours have passed, we're at Heathrow and jet bridge is locked - disembark time, last guy on 777.  I groggily wake, sprawled across all 3 seats, left cheecky covered in drool... I quickly realize my vcinity is completely littered with crumbs and well over a dozen candy/snack wrappers. Sleep eating, sleep walking, sleep snatching(?), ffffuuuu... I start to apologize profusely, knowing I probably raided the attendants' cabin without courtesy multiple times in sleep - Ambien hadn't done it to me at that I was aware of but it's notorious for inducing sleep walking, food foraging and eating.  She interrupts to scold me - again apparently - in a sweet British accent for ""requesting cape cods while medicated"". 

Since when the fuck do I drink cape cods??  In my dreams, I guess

yllib87,caeywq,"This actually happened today, but it starts when I was 8.

My dad took me to PetSmart when I was 8 to pick out a cat during a big adoption event. There was a guy doing a demo of some all natural litter and his gimmick was give you a cup of 'brand x' litter and a cup of his litter. In each cup he put some diluted ammonia in the litter and you were supposed to smell the difference. He handed me the cup of 'brand x' and I didn't smell anything at all. He thought maybe as an 8 year old I didn't know what ammonia smelled like so he gave it to my dad and he said it smelled like ammonia. Turns out some people just can't smell ammonia. When I got a bit older I looked into it to see if it was a thing where something was actually wrong or maybe I was missing out on other smells. Nope, just a weird human thing where some of us are missing certain smell receptors. I did find that in large quantities I would still be able to pick up enough scent to not die and my body would still react to it and try to warn me so thats good.

Fast forward to today. We have a certain cleaner we use in the store I work in that comes in big gallon jugs so we put it in UNLABELED spray bottles. I needed to clean up some sticky mess around the coffee bar and grabbed that cleaner. It wasn't really doing the job so I switched to a spray bottle of diluted bleach. As many times as I have refilled the other cleaner I never once read the label on the jug. I am a weird dude and like to read labels of stuff so I don't know why I hadn't read that one. So, I crawl back into the small poorly ventilated cabinet I was cleaning and sprayed some bleach around. My throat got really scratchy and my eyes started watering. My stomach was starting to turn over and I got light headed so I got up. Next thing I know a concerned customer was scooping me off the floor.

I read the label after I got back to normal. The non-cleaning cleaner contains ammonia. Ammonia plus bleach equals chloramine a very bad thing to inhale. I still have a bit of a headache but am feeling fine just stupid because I do know better than to mix ANY cleaners with bleach just in case it contains ammonia or other chemicals. I have also now written ammonia on the cleaner bottle so I don't forget and so everyone else knows (the bleach bottle is labeled already).

TheScaryColeman,cagqev,"This actually happened to me a couple years ago. The year was 2015. I was 24 going on 25 years old and working full-time at a summer camp. Now, I know I'm not the greatest looking dude in the world, but I've also never been lacking in confidence; not usually at least. There have definitely been a handful of times where I've been so awestruck by a woman's existence that I had a hard time formulating a coherent sentence. It's like my brain turns into mashed potatoes. There was one time, however, that I managed to progress beyond the total derp and actually asked this particular girl out. To my surprise, she told me that she had actually liked me for a while. Apparently my brain was just too scrambled to comprehend the massive hints that she had been dropping in my direction, and when I told her that I felt like she was out of my league, she just grabbed my hand, smiled, and said ""There are no leagues."" My heart completely melted. It was probably the most touching moment of our entire relationship, but that didn't last long. We never did become an official couple. In fact, things between us ended after about a month. It turned out to just be a summer fling.

She came back to work again the following summer. It was awkward at first, but we managed to put the entire thing behind us and became friends-- or so I thought. That summer I got into another relationship, and I guess she didn't like that very much. I soon found out that she had been telling people, including the girl who I had just started dating, that I had stalked her the summer prior and that I was psycho, wild, and undatable. She even went so far as to deny that we ever had any sort of romantic relationship to begin with. I learned about this through people who she didn't know were my friends. Word travels fast around camp. My friends knew that she was lying, and the girl I was dating knew that she was lying, but it still hurt. I considered confronting her about it, but I just let it go because it only tarnished my reputation amongst people who didn't really matter.

In the end I lost a friend, but I learned something from it. I learned that just because you're attracted to someone, that doesn't necessarily mean you're a good match for each other. Relationships aren't meant to be only skin deep.

dix13,cafol5,"This happened a couple of weeks ago. Worth saying, this happened in Florida. In Florida, storms can pop up any time during the summer. However, the storms this day had already been forecasted, and it had rained numerous times earlier in the day. My Uncle got his snapper fishing gear together and called my brother and I. We agreed to going out on the boat. This was a rare opportunity, despite the shitty conditions. I asked my uncle about the weather outside, but he said that he hoped it would clear up (remember this). We get on his boat and start across Pensacola Bay heading towards the Gulf of Mexico. It was beginning to look ugly outside, and the waves and wind were picking up. As we start to round the curve towards Three Mile Bridge, we can see a nasty squall line approaching. Lightning bolts flashed above Gulf Breeze and Downtown Pensacola. Here is where I fucked up. My Uncle suggested the option of hightailing it back to the house, or continuing on. My brother and I eventually agreed to muscling through the squall line. We slowed our approached to the bridge as it got very ugly. The waves were small, but an absolute downpour drowned out everything. The rain made visibility nearly impossible. I had to visually guide my Uncle to the bridge, and the pouring rain stung my eyes.

A path of ""calmer"" weather had formed directly on our path, and we passed through the squall line unscathed, but that's not the end of the story. We got out into the Gulf as a system was building up farther to the West, but we paid no mind to it. The Gulf water was extremely rough to begin with. We were going out to a spot called the ""Paradise Hole"", a limestone reef off of Pensacola Beach in about 100 ft. of water. We have to take it slow because of the waves, so the ride took about an hour. Then, as we get out there, the monster of a system that had been forming to the west had swung around for us. My Uncle took over the driving. We had to go out further to avoid the downpour and lighting that was very visible. However, the waves and wind were dangerously strong. The boat rocked so hard that I was convinced that we would capsize. My Uncle said that he needed to keep the boat moving or we would capsize. Capsizing miles out in the gulf would mean death, especially in a storm. However, my Uncle is a very experienced seaman, and has been in way worse situations before. He was able to guide us through the waves. However, we were coming down form the top of one wave, and a wave came over the bow. Water sloshed into the boat. It wasn't a lot of water, but enough to get our attention. We had to rough through it for about another hour.

The system eventually cleared out. It was pretty afterwards, but I have never been more scared. I remember saying two decades of the rosary in my head, one when we were facing the squall line, and one when we were nearly capsizing.

I'll do my best to keep it clean for guys like Rslash and Emkay but no promises.

So a little background. A couple of weeks ago I had a few friends over to studying (I just finnished first semester exams). One of my friends used my on suite bathroom and broken the door handle clean off when he came out. We tried installing a new one immediately but gave up pretty soon as it became a very tedious task. I never bothered to actually fix it afterwards so whenever I use that bathroom I just leave the door cracked open because it can only be opened from the outside. 

Now the f-up. I was home alone as my dad was out on a date. I go to the bathroom and after I do what needs to be done I go to reach for the door handle forgetting that it isn't there... And this time closed the door completely. After a few minutes of futile attempts at trying to open the door I give up and go to plan B. There's one window without gaurd bars but the drop to the ground on the outside is about 3 meters (almost 10 feet). I jump down and stick the landing. But now I have a different problem... I locked out of the house. 

Luckily I've had to break into my own house many times before but we have a few more obstacles than we used to. First I had to break into the laundry room. The door only has one of those sliding locks and I noticed the next to the door is locked but ever so slightly cracked open. I find a piece of wire somewhere in the garden and after about 10 minutes of struggling I manage to get the wire through the crack and unlock the window. So now I could just reach in and unlock the door. 

Next I had to get into the house through the window between the laundry and kitchen(this is normally the only obstacle). Opening the window from the outside without breaking it took me another 15 minutes but I eventually managed. I climb through and almost break a few glasses as I have to jump over the sink. 

I stand up and I'm fairly impressed with myself and as I turn to head back to my room... I hear a key opening the front door and my dad walks in.

Sorry this wasn't an extremely exciting post but it's my first one and I was just happy to be able to post something.

I was sick with a throat infection yesterday and fell asleep on the couch in the living room. I woke up at 7 remembering I had a psychology assignment-draft due 8 and quickly scrambled to reach my laptop to do some last-minute fixes and to send it in. So there I was, expanding on the evaluation I should have written last night when I heard my parents enter and quickly leave the kitchen to quickly head for the car. They drove off somewhere, no clue where but they are still gone now. I started to notice a strange sweet smell coming from the kitchen, but the living room doors were closed and didn't allow me to see the white smoke just yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I handed in the draft and thought:"" wow rad, what do i do now?"" So I head to my room and smoke the last little bit of the bud I had lying around.... yeah i know throat infection and all that it is pretty stupid to smoke let alone while you are sick. I have to tell you right now my throat doesn't hurt anymore, so I stand by what I did!

&amp;#x200B;

I then investigate the weird smell so I opened the kitchen doors and this huge wall of white smoke just hit me in the moneymaker. Not breathing and confused i dash through the kitchen and see that my mom put an automatic dishwasher tab on a pan on the cooking field on 6/9, I grab the fucking pan and run outside and put it in our driveway and run back inside to open windows and shit. But i forgot to breathe while i was outside, at this poin in the fuckup i am already blazed and not really in a shape to be doing this.

So the inevitable thing happens, I can't further resist breathing and engorge on a huge fat cloud all the vapers would be proud of and have to cough and stuff while tumbling back out of the kitchen. I thought the few windows and the ventilation that I got started would deal with the problem and i just grab my laptop and head outside. Out there I meet my sweetheart cat who bolted out of the house as fast as it went into the house when i opened the door and it won't stop touching me and keeps **aggressively purring** at me.

Sitting in front of me on the bus, is the very same Brittney. Now Brittney decides this is the best time for her to say ""I love you"" to me while I'm on the phone with Jeff. Now, keep in mind that in this moment I still think Jeff didn't hear what she said and I casually say ""Oh, someones talking to me right now, I'll call you later"" Now after Brittney ripped out Jeffs heart, I casually lit it on fire and left it for him to watch slowly burn =(

Undercovermother19,cafjpz,"So this fuck up happened a long time, when I was 6 years old to be specific. I was in the first grade in PRimary School. My mom used to work at the local post office which was right next to my school. I used to go over there sometimes to have lunch and sometimes to ask her for extra money. There used to be a toy shop really close by that was selling a toy gun that I really wanted.

 I  had saved all my daily allowance over  two weeks and still did not have enough to be able to purchase the toy gun. One day at school I had a eureka moment. Around lunch time I asked my friend to accompany me to the post office. My mom was on leave and her coworker was the only one there. I told my friend to ask her to give me some money because I was hungry and that my mom forgot to give me lunch money. She obliged and gave it to me.  In the evening after school I went and got myself the toy gun. 

A few days later my mom got a call  about the money from her coworker. Needless to say, she was absolutely livid about the whole situation. My mom grounded me for two weeks and didn't give an allowance for a month in order to pay back her coworker.

OverstarAnthony,cafat2,"While not as major as the other rather sexual, weird fuck ups, it's still a fuck up in my book.

I am becoming a freshman this year in September, and I will be running cross country.

On the first meetup (June 6th), we were told the information for the team, including summer conditioning, advice, and a Remind class to remind about practices and meets.

I did not know how to use the Remind app. I should've asked the coach on if it was the right class, but me being me thought it was certainly the right one and that it was just my assistant coach running it (I knew the coach, but not the assistant coach). I mean, the high school had the same initials as the high school I'm running for, so it couldn't be wrong, right??

I then received a message (in the middle of June) to go to a park with the name of the park typed in. I then typed the park in, and I discovered that it was in New York City (I live an hour away from there) and decided that it was too far and I wouldn't be going.

Then, the day I'm typing this (July 7th) was checking my remind app. I then decided to email the coach although I did not send it because I then realized...

The fuck up.

I realized that my profile was a student to a different school and not mine, so I then thought that maybe the assistant coach just taught there and he was working at my school for a cross country coach.

I then typed in my school and deleted the other one, and I was removed from the class. I then realized that I screwed up big time, and I looked up the name of my high school, scrolled to my XC team class and joined it.

I then decided to look up the high school that I was in the wrong class for, and I found out the high school and the park was in Alabama. Fucking Alabama. I then looked up the park. Also Alabama.

My home state is New York, so the fact that I was in a class for a high school for a whole different class in a state for an entire month in a different region of the country hundreds of miles from where I live shocks me a lot.

TL;DR: Didn't know how to use the Remind app, went on some class for another different team in Alabama, was not able to know what was going on in my team for a whole entire month.

Luckily, the summer practices were only optional and I have been practicing for the past month.

This happened last week, my girlfriend and I moved to the UK, and booked a flight with AirCanada from Toronto to Glasgow with my cat registered as my carry on. We had all the necessary paperwork to validate he is healthy, and had read through all the airport rules about flying with pets, in both Canada and the UK. 

Upon arrival our passports were confiscated and we were both detained by custom. They confiscated the cat and sent him in quarantine until a government vet was able to validate our paperwork. The fuckup pretty much stops here as the rest is AirCanada and UK customs fault. It took another 12 hours for us to be released and regain custody of our beloved cat. 

The government vet on call was not picking up despite it being 7 AM in Glasgow. They were not able to reach the secondary vet on call causing further delays. Because we were not able to go through the standard procedure with the vet, the pet was handed off to first-responders, who despite their best efforts (and kindness) were not the appropriate body to handle the situation, causing further delays. Eventually the paperwork was sent to a government vet in England and they were able to clear the cat.

 While we were detained, customs treated us like criminals who were illegally trying to bring a pet in the UK, and not some victims of a clerical error. They were extremely rude and multiple times tried to antagonize me further by telling me I know what I was doing and overall being dicks. 


After paying 500 pounds to release the cat, we caught a cab out of there ASAP. We are currently in talks with Air Canada and UK customs for compensation, but as you'd expect things are moving very slowly. At no point did the several people who verified the cat stop us or inform us of the law in Canada, this includes the custom agent in the UK redirecting us off the plane towards the checkpoint. We mentioned we had a cat and couldn't pass through the automated checkpoint, so they brought us to the manual checkpoint before a panic broke out. (Obviously rabies is serious business). A side note is UK airport law doesn't mention this pet in cargo ban at all, because it is UK Law not specific to our airport, so we didn't come across the information on our many searches. (Took about 3 months to get the cat's paperwork ready with various governmental agencies in Canada). 

TL;DR: AirCanada let me illegally board a plane bound for the UK with a pet in cabin, causing me to be detained for 12+ hours and my cat to be confiscated and a 500 pound fee to get him back.

EcoEon,caorn9,"This happened about five minutes ago, but my thumb still hurts. I'm a college student, so I'm always trying to find ways to save money. Since it's the summer and always 90+ degrees outside, my AC is constantly running. To try and cut down on my electricity bill, I decided I was going to use an Arduino to make a device that would turn off the AC if my room got too cold or if I wasn't home. 

I bought a thermometer sensor so the device would automatically turn off the AC if my room got too cold. When reading the wiring instructions, I noticed it said in bold ""be very careful, because if you connect it wrong the sensor will heat up to 280+ C(540 F) and might get damaged."". Considering myself an above average electrician, I promptly disregarded the warning. There's no way I mess up connecting two wires, right? WRONG.   


I finally get everything wired up and look at the output on my computer. That's weird, the computer says my room is 250 degrees. Well, it doesn't feel like 250 degrees in here, maybe my conversions on the computer were wrong. So my brilliant brain decided the genius course of action would be to grab the sensor that my computer says is 250 degrees to see what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Cue instant barbecued thumb. After dropping it and cursing the shit out of myself, I disconnected the sensor and figured out the right way to wire it. The sensor isn't burning to the touch anymore, but says my room is 166 degrees.

So a bit of context, I live in a very small, relatively crime-free college town. I USED to live in a very big, crime-ridden major city. I grew up in said city, and thanks to that, I tend to err on the side of ""gunshot"" over ""firework"" when trying to decide the answer of ""the hell was that loud bang that went off on the other side of the block in the dead of night?""  


Now, I myself own no firearms, but what I do own is a very cheap Walmart-brand camping machete, with a sheath to go in. Now, I wasn't just planning to charge in, my plan was to observe at distance, determine whether there were shenanigans afoot, and contact the police. If spotted, zig-zag and only draw my ""sword"" if the enemy followed me and got close enough to melee.   


So I walk out of my 2nd story apartment and down the stairs from my balcony, dressed only in a bathrobe and flat sandals, my left hand holding my machete in its sheath, my right hand over the handle in my best approximation of an Iaido stance, ready to draw and slash in one fluid motion at the slightest provocation. I'd like to imagine I just walked out of a Tokugawa-era period drama. I probably looked much stupider in reality.

The only reason why I still have a left thumb right now is because I wasn't putting THAT much pressure on the back of the blade, merely resting my thumb on top of it. That said, I still had to beat a tactical retreat to my apartment for the first-aid kit, and was honestly lucky that the first-aid kit was all that was required.

sadaboutmybody,caovq0,"Over two months ago, my husband got me a gym membership to Orange Theory as a way to improve my overall cardiovascular health, endurance, and strength. Before going on this journey with him, I would say I was pretty normal. Not obese, but not super fit. I was always active but not to the degree that he wanted me to be. I biked to work daily as my exercise and commute. But I never did have the petite and super toned frame that he admired in some of my close friends who were in Asian-interest sororities back in college. My husband, on the other hand, has always been athletic and 3 years ago really got into triathlons and Ironmans. His goal for me is to ultimately get me to at least finish a half-IM race, but I’m not sure that is really realistic for me. 

When I first started Orange Theory, I did the weigh in and goals with the staff. I was at 5ft6 and 126 lbs. at the weigh in, and my husband encouraged me to set a goal of 120 lbs by the end of three months, and to have improved ab and tricep definition since I am lacking in muscle definition. In the beginning, I went to about 2 classes a week with my husband, and I discovered it was quite fun. So he upgraded our memberships to unlimited classes and encouraged me to go 5 times a week. At first, I started out as a “power walker” on the treadmill, but I have since graduated to a “runner”. I feel like I am seeing some definition in my abs and triceps and thighs and buttocks. Throughout the first two months, I would secretly weigh myself about once a week when he is in the shower to see if I’m making progress. I combined the classes with portion control as he suggested and I did see myself moving towards my goal in the first two months. However, with the long weekend this past week and family/friends visiting, I forgot to weigh myself for a couple weeks. 

Today, after our “strength” work out, I was feeling particularly good about myself. I maintained a “running” pace throughout hill climbs on the treadmill, and got my highest wattage ever on the rowing machine. I got too excited and weighed myself before my husband got in the shower. He saw me weighing myself and peeked over my head (he’s way taller than I am) to see my weight. To my horror I lost ground and am back at 126 lbs. My husband didn’t say anything, he just jumped in the shower and I’m sure disappointed. He left for work without saying much. I don’t have much time left before the 3 month period ends and I lost all the progress I was making towards our goal. Worst of all, I was feeling so confident I let my husband see my weight and disappointed him.

My buddies and I flew out to a convention in Pittsburgh. We met up with some others to hang out and get a showing of the place as it was our first convention. We had a blast as we drank, danced, listened in on panels, etc. It was a one-of-a-kind experience I plan on having again. 

Among my time there, I ended up checking out some of the more raunchy dealers at the dealers room, partly due to curiosity and also to buy some gag gifts for family and friends. I ended up finding something perfect. There were some mousepads that had been designed with some... impressive... wristpad cushions. These were an inside joke between a couple of my folks so I grabbed two. They were still in their clamshell packaging; I stored them in my backpack for the duration of the con.

Here is where I messed up. I kept the mousepads in my backpack as we packed everything on the last day of our hotel stay for the flight back home. I ended up having to grab another piece of luggage to accommodate for all the souvenirs, plushies, art, and ""art"". I would check it into the flight later. I never moved the mousepads into the new bag though. It was still in my backpack. Which would come with me through the TSA checkpoint.

The generous butt-pillows that would act as the savior from carpal tunnel must have been made with gel or something more fluid, because I made it through the checkpoint along with my laptop, pocketed items, and other carry-on bag. But my backpack was being carried by two TSA agents to search. I kept my face as straight as possible as the first agent explained that their xrays showed some round masses they could not explain. They checked the larger pocket for my slippers. They pulled out some snacks...

And there was the plastic bag containing the mousepads. My face was bright red as the first agent grabbed the first clamshell containing the sensually-designed novelty.

""Oh!"" said the second agent, realizing what was on it, ""That's nice.""

The first agent stayed silent in response, and maintained this unspoken vow as he put the plastic bag insulating my degenerate erotica from the world back into my backpack. I didn't need a mirror to know my face was cherry-red from the ordeal.

However, I met my dog in a very unique way... An afternoon, I was walking in the forest with a few friends. There he was, alone, really sad : I instantly knew I had to save him.

He really looked like a wolf, but a bit smaller. He was kinda scared of us, but we had an idea! We just finished eating chicken (delicious by the way), and we still had the bones! You probably know what I did, and it worked! He ran and came to us. He started eating the bones, and his tail went up!

I was so happy to find my new and beautiful dog!

JoshYx,caq2gi,"Obligatory this happened like a week ago, and not to me, but a friend. I'll tell the story from his perspective though.

I was playing basketball with a couple friends at a fenced court near an elementary school at around 9pm. We put our bags and a spare basketball near the bench at side of the court.

Two young girls (looked like 5 year olds) take the spare basketball and start playing with it. I didn't mind, what's the worst that could happen?

Anyway, these girls were having fun playing around. No problem. About an hour later, I went to collect my basketball, as I planning on leaving somewhat soon. The girls were really hyper and refused to return the ball.

As I was trying to take my ball back, they began trying to pull my pants down, grabbing my ass and laughing their heads off. 

I looked around for any adult that could potentially be a parent and saw no one. I managed to get the ball back and ran into the cour closing the gat behind me. They chased me and were screaming and laughing. After a minute or two they got bored and went back to playing in the park near by.

I continued to play with my friends for a bit, thinking I wouldn't be bothered by the girls again.

Boy was I wrong. I heard some noise behind me, I looked over and saw one of the girls picking up my backpack. She raised it over her head and SLAMMED it into the ground as hard as her 5 year old body allowed her to. I immediately began running over but didn't get there in time to prevent her from slamming the bag down one more time.

I got there and started yelling at them, they immediately ran away across the park. Time to assess the damage... Both my laptop and phone were smashed up. Screens shattered, and my laptop's body was deformed. The phone was still working, so I put it in my pocket.

In the distance I could see the girls across the field and on some bleachers what looked like their parents (What kind of parent lets their five-year-olds run around a park for an hour, too far away to be able to supervise them???).

I ran up to the parents, explaining the situation to them. They didn't seem to care much. The girls started crying at this point, and the dad pulled the ol' ""now my kid is crying! Look what you've done!"" on me. Then he threatened to call the police on me, for harassment! Thinking the police would by on my side, I said ""you know what, I'll call the cops right now!""

At that point, the father realized he could be in trouble and started walking away. I asked for his name, but he wouldn't give it. Meanwhile, the police answered my call. I asked them what I could do, and they basically just laughed at my story and told my I couldn't do anything. Following them would be harassment, they said.

I filed a police report after that, but again, this was only met with ridicule.

zephyrlilly,caq4pb,"This happened when I was in college so not exactly today.

I played for my university's ice hockey team. It was fun, I was happy to finally be able to play a sport, something my mom wouldn't let me do when I was a kid. We weren't the best team, most of us hadn't played hockey before, but we were having fun.

My background was always music. I played in the orchestra, I sang in the choir, I was in the music small school of my high school, I was always a musical kid but college was a time for me to find new interests so I joined the Women's Hockey Team and just neglected my violin.

Late in the season, we had a game against the nearest city's women's team. That was also the game I learned that we could have a teammate sing the national anthem--normally it was a recording or one of the people that worked at the rink--so my brilliant idea was to sing the national anthem for the game, something I hid from the rest of my team because I'm shy when it comes to my singing but I'm not a bad singer. Mostly, I just didn't want one girl on the team to say shit to me until the day of the game. And it worked, they didn't find out until the day of the game.

Here's how I fucked up.

The day of the game, I called my mom. We had agreed to do weekly calls to keep each other updated on our lives. I told her I was going to sing the national anthem at my game that day and that I was really nervous but also excited. Her immediate response was ""Oh, don't forget the words."" I found that strange because she'd never said that to me before.

As I said, I was in choir since the fourth grade and every year, I've had to sing the national anthem with my choir for multiple events. I could sing the national anthem backward if I tried. Hell, I could even sing the Canadian National Anthem if they requested it. So my dumb ass just laughed it off and soon, I had to end the call to head to the game.

After we warm up, the moment has arrived. So I skate to the microphone feeling very confident, looking super adorable in my hockey gear and pigtails, and I start singing.

After the first verse, my mind goes blank and I can't remember the second verse. I just close my eyes and hope to disappear because a good couple seconds pass before everyone realizes that I can't remember the words. My team starts laughing but the opposing team who were standing behind me start to whisper the words to me so I can finish the song with what little dignity I have remaining and just hide behind the boards until it's my turn on the ice.

Oh, and I also had to sing the anthem for the next game the next day where the guy I was talking to at the time was going to be because he had a game immediately after ours and promised he would be there. For that, and the two other times, I just wrote the words on my hand.

When I called my mom after the game, I told her I forgot the words and she just laughed at me. The only acceptable response, really.

And even though I was disgusted I tried cleaning it and after a layer it was RED. I immediately vomited and pushed it back. It's 3 hours later, my dick hurts so much that I can't even put underwear on and I tried cleaning again 30 minutes ago and now I can't even pull it back... Help?

So today I fucked up by sucking dick in a park. 
How was this a fuck up? Well let me tell you.

Starting about a month ago or so, I matched with this person (we will call them B) on Tinder, I had been following B on Instagram for a while so I was vaguely familiar with them. 

B and I start chatting, I give them my number and we start texting, things are going great, or so I think. 
I’ve never necessarily been great at reading people but I knew I was into B, however B started talking about wanting a sugar daddy and potentially meeting up with one, so in my brain was like 
“damn, looks like they arent into me the way I am into them. that’s fine, we can be pals.”

I had just sort of accepted that they weren’t into me like that, so here’s where the fuck up happens.

I download a hook up app, chat with someone for a little bit and agree to meet up with them, we meet in a park about a 10 minute walk from my house, we chat a little, then we kiss and then I suck their dick, then that’s that and we both go home. 
Cool whatever, right? 
Wrong.

I vaguely mention this encounter to B and then we kinda get into details and suddenly B is shocked and hurt and I realized I fucked up. B tells me that they’re into me and I just kind of realize i’m boo boo the fool. 

I should’ve taken more time to communicate and talk about how i feel instead I went out and sucked a dick and it definitely wasn’t even worth it. I hope things between B and I recover, but who knows.

TL;DR thought the person i was interested in wasn’t interested in me, so i met up with someone from a hook up app, sucked their dick, then the person i’m interested in found out and was hurt because they are interested in me",tifu,TIFU by sucking a strangers dick
jmarco6969,c9vlba,"Last week I was having difficulty falling asleep and after 2 hours of tossing and turning, I decided to try a different approach. I went into the office, put my browser in private browsing mode, and found some porn to watch. It wasn’t just any porn I put on, it was trans porn (Male + TGirl). I put on my headphones so my wife and kid couldn't hear anything and I could enjoy my experience. 

I’m watching the video with my hard cock in my hand, stroking away. As I’m getting close to finishing off, I see something out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look and it was my wife standing in the doorway in “shock” to see that I was in office, jerking off. I tried to get my boxers back on as quickly as possible, obviously still having a “hard on”, which makes it harder to hide anything, so I can try to explain the situation to her. She quickly left to go back to our bedroom before I could say or do anything to diffuse the situation. 

I come back into the bedroom a minute later to see her back turns towards me and I crawl back into bed with “blue balls” since I didn't finish. I wasn’t able to sleep that night as I was trying to figure out how I was going to explain this to my wife. 

The next morning, we barely spoke to each other or made much eye contact, I could sense disappointment and confusion in the tone of her voice. Now it’s been 3 days now, things are not back to how they were as we haven’t spoken more than is necessary. I don’t know how to even begin to bring this topic up with my wife. I don’t know what will happen to our 10 year marriage.

This didnt happen today but has been an inside joke between my friends and myself for years. 

Mobile. 

Fake Name(s). Other than Dad Kroeger

The year 2000 or 2001 was the height of my parents divorce. My dad had moved out and my mom planned a girl's night of sorts with our...sultry neighbor, Sandy in Kansas City. The Missouri side, not Kansas... I know, gross if it was the Kansas side, right? Let me get back to telling you about Chad Kroeger most likely left my mother silver side up. 

So she went on her weekend trip and everything was back to normal. She told me about how she had met Nickleback that night at a bar and were invited to hang out with them in their hotel. 

My mom worked two jobs at the time, and being 13 or so, I thought, 'hey, cool, my mom met kinda famous people."" Nickelback was popular at the time but Spiderman 2 wasnt out yet, so they were yet to peak.

A decade or so later, my mom has happily remarried. Situations occured and she saw someone she knew leaving a hotel room with someone that wasnt his wife. She was understandably upset and told me about how, ""Nobody goes to a hotel room like that to just hang out.""

The cogs clicked into place pretty quickly. It wasnt so much cool anymore that my mom met kinda famous people before they really got huge, but more of a, my recently divorced mother met fairly famous people with our also recently divorced promiscuous neighbor at a bar and went back to their hotel room to hang out where people don't just hang out. 

So. To this day, and it'll take a lot of convincing otherwise, I wholeheatedly believe that my newly single mother met Nickleback on a trip to Kansas City, and now my father is weiner cousins with Chad and the lot of 'em. 

I just hope he had moved on from my actual saint of a mother by the time Figured You Out was written and played.

Tldr: Years after the event while telling me about how people dont just go to hotel rooms with people that aren't their spouse, my mother most likely confessed to Nickeback making her feel way too damn good in the height of her divorce back in 2000 or so.",tifu,TIFU by realizing that my mom was most likely plowed by Chad Kroeger and/or any/all of the goons in Nickelback
Muhfuggajones,c84pl3,"So I've held in this breath ever since I was told just yesterday, but I slept with a girl I had only been talking to for a few months. Maybe even less than that now that I am thinking while writing this. A couple of weeks go by and I don't see her too much due to some life things getting in the way for both of us. We're both single parents, and are in no way equipped to bring a child into this world. Before we hooked up, it had been a while since I'd done the deed, and we only fucked once so needless to say I didn't last long. 

Here's my fuckup, I didn't wrap my meat and shortly after our first round (got cum all over my hand, her leg, and my sheets after pulling out) we had round 2 for a while maybe 20 minutes later. Now I never came the second time, but god dammit, I hate myself right now. 

Here's her fuckup. She let me know just a few hours ago that there was someone else she was fucking not only 2 days before we made the beast with two backs.

I was floored at this news (literally lying on my floor gripping the carpet) but kept my cool and just shrugged it off over the phone. We talked it through and ended the call after about 30 minutes. I'm about to spend the next 9 months barely eating and sleeping due to the soul crushing and mind numbing stress I'm already feeling. I'm cancelling some music festival plans I'd made for this year, and I don't know how to break the news to my parents (dads currently battling stage 4 cancer) and idk how to break it to my baby mama. Granted, when my daughter was 7 months old she broke the news to me she was 4 months preggo (not mine) soooooo idk how mad she can really get. I'm at my wits end people. I called my best friend just now and left a voice message that teeters on ""I'm going to kill myself"" kind of vibe. I haven't slept or ate since I found out, and I'm fucking scared as all can be. Please be advised, pre cum is a thing....maybe.

throwawayofdisgustx,c8xtgx,"This is a throwaway because I’m genuinely embarrassed and need to vent about it but have NO ONE FIND OUT. And yes-this happened today. Like 29 mins ago.

So, I’m a girl–and you know how teenagers are. Especially since it’s the only way I can fall asleep with my increasing insomnia. I’ve come to terms with that fact, especially because of how long I’ve been doing this. As most people are, I usually just like to completely forget that I have this in my routine because I’m incredibly embarrassed.

Listen, the only way I’ll actually feel any relief is if I cum three times. Which is...unfortunate, because by the end I just want to stop. My hand hurts, I’m tired, the content gets boring. Whatever. 

So, tonight wasn’t anything unusual. I really want to go to bed, so I decided to get it over with a bit earlier. Because of this, my light is on. This is not going where you think it’s going, and I can’t tell if that’s a good thing or not.

So I finish, go to the bathroom so I don’t get a UTI, to return to my bed and find my sheets literally soaking wet. If I managed to squirt, I didn’t know I even had the ability. So now I am typing this up in shame, and slight disgust with myself.

I was busy working outside where I am a Parking Lot Attendant where I push and pull carts. Outside I have to constantly keep an eye on what is happening and what is going on outside for all I know I could get tun over by a car.

That gets me into staring, I have a tendency to look at girls... alot. Whether they are cute,pretty, attractive, or just a girl. The period of staring is where it gets different, I stare longer at girls I really think are beautiful. 

People can feel someone else's gaze it is natural, I can feel when someone is looking at me and someone can feel when I am lookong at them.

Now here's the story in play, I stare alot. I saw this girl, subconsciously I start staring at her. Then My eyes move up and down, next thing I know I am staring directly at her butt. At this point I don't pay attention and I just keep staring, she takes notice. And she says hi. I being stupid trying to act like everything was cool said hi back. She caught me looking and I recognized her recognizing that I was looking. Maybe I could've used the ""Do I know you from High School"" excuse.

hugeredditdummy,c9iyxh,"I had a horrific week. Won't go into details, but for context I've been stressed out and on edge. Doesn't excuse my behavior.

I was going for a run in my neighborhood this morning at around 8 AM. I was heading down a running / bicycling path, and an off-leash German Shepherd heads towards me. The owner is looking at his phone, and I yell ""GET YOUR DOG."" He looks up and calls his dog back, who heads back towards him.

I say ""put a leash on that damn thing,"" to which he sarcastically replies ""thanks for the tip asshole.""

At this point I should have just walked away, but instead I cork off all the frustration I've been feeling this week and say ""Go fuck yourself.""

He tells me to fuck myself in return, and turns around to continue his walk. I should have let it go. Instead I start walking towards him, asking to repeat what he just said. I think internally I was hoping he'd react physically so I could just fight this asshole and get my ya-ya's out.

Then the guy turns to face me, and his dog charges towards me. I stand my ground and get ready to kick the shit out of this dog. When he's about 5 feet away he calls the dog back and starts walking away again.

I continue shouting at this guy following him for about a block. I'm filming the whole thing in case he sends his dog at me again. After about a block the guy arrives at his house.

He says to me ""look, I need to go to work, will you just leave me alone?"" At this point I'm in a blind rage, and I tell him I'm going to call the police.

His wife comes out, and she asks the guy to apologize. He sends her inside. I tell the guy his wife seems nice. I call the police.

He says he can't have his address associated with a police report. I am so angry that I don't give a fuck. I'm literally taking out all my rage on this asshole I just met.

The police arrive, ask both of us our story. They tell me they have everything they need from me. They escort the dude into his house. I jog home.

PaperTronics,c9huxs," So,  around 4 days ago, I was browsing twitter in a shopping mall using the shitty internet provided there, and saw Gallowboob's tweet about some  people sending him death threats and stuff. I decided to reply to the  tweet with a joke essay full of hate and anger for the guy, and how I  had gathered data to exploit him and how he was a karmawhore and  whatnot.

I broke the whole essay into  three replies due to the stupid word limit on twitter, and in the third  reply I said in the end the [/u/shittymorph](https://www.reddit.com/u/shittymorph/)  meme thing (in 1969 Undertaker threw mankind...) and I included an /s. I  also made some horrible english mistakes in the essay which I had not  realized while typing. Anyways, my phone's battery was like at 4% and I  quickly finished the essay and hit send.

My  phone died, and after 4 hours when I returned from the mall, I saw  Gallowboob had been bamboozled. He had blocked me before reading the 3rd  tweet and assumed I was another one of those assholes. When he realized  that it was a joke and it had an /s in the end, he unblocked me and  reached out to me saying he laughed so much when he read the last tweet  and that he would get his revenge. I laughed a lot too, and that was the  end of it... ***or was it?***

Next  day, I wake up and open twitter. To my surprise, twitter had banned my  account because of ""Violating our rules against hateful conduct."" and it had my tweet as the reason/proof. Now I don't know whether someone was  dumb enough to report that tweet, or twitter just had bots that banned  anyone looking like they were sending hate, or both of these things  happened. In any way, I have appealed to twitter about this saying that  my third tweet clearly specified that it was a joke and the person I was  sending it to realized that. Waiting for the reply.

My best friend’s grandmother landed in the intensive care unit yesterday. Today I visited her in the ICU with my best friend. I was hungry so I went to the cafeteria to buy some tater tots. On my way back to the room, I dropped a tater tot on the floor in the hallway of the ICU and it rolled to stop just outside another patient’s ICU room. Thankfully it didn’t go in because there was some sort of gown isolation thing in that room. I was super embarrassed and there wasn’t a trash right by me, so I quickly picked up the tater tot and put it on a cleared side of my paper plate, with the plan to chuck it in my friend’s grandmother’s ICU room where there was a trash can. 

When I got to the room, the doctor had just come in to discuss important medical issues. So I left the plate of tater tots on the tray table and listened with my best friend. After the discussion, I went back to the food but by that time I was already so distracted by the conversation that I had completely forgotten about the tater tot.

So this FU didnt happen recently, but actually like 3 years ago at this time I was in 9th grade of high school and on summer break so I was going to 10th after this.

So I dont exactly know why I did this but now I guess it was just for the adrenaline rush because I had done this a few times before in the same place. Now this day was a very boring day for me, my dad was laying down and nothing was going on around the house so I ask my dad if I can go ride my bike around the neighborhood. He said yes and I got on my bike and rode away.

In my neighborhood there is a boat dock at the very end that goes into a lake and that is where I did my dirty work. So I had done this like 3 times before, I would basically go from door to door and see if any were unlocked. This particular day there was a very nice jeep with a trailer on the back with a jet ski on it so me being me I decided to take a look I set my bike in front of the jeep and go to the driver side door and try to open it and to my luck/unluckines it was unlocked.I look around real quick before I look around the jeep

So I look in the jeep and there really isn't much there but when I look under the seat I see the key to the jetski on the back and i decide to take those , I look around for a few more seconds and pull my head out and a truck pulls around the corner, I shut the door as fast as I can but they already saw me. At this point I'm a little frozen but they speed up there truck and park and get out and start yelling at me and it turns out that the jeep was his son's jeep.

So I tried to play it off saying I was just checking out the interior and stuff like that but it wasnt working and that's when one of them tried to grab me he got ahold of me but I jerked away and ran I kicked out his friend that was with him and keep in mind these are grown ass men so they get in their truck and start to follow me. As I'm running they start to asked me questions about who I am and where I live but obviously I didnt tell them but they tell me they are calling the police and I just bolt and out of pure adrenaline jump an 8 foot privacy fence into a big ditch that is behind the houses I loose them and decide to run home and I'm freaking out.

A little bit later the police knock on the door and I'm in my room so my dad answers the door and my dad calls me because they asked if there was any boys or somthing in the house so I go up there still a little bit freaked out but I play it off as smooth as I can they asked me if I knew a Jason cause that is the name I gave to those guys and I said he might be in the apartments that are in the middle of my neighborhood but in the middle of talking the guys that caught me saw my face and it was over from there I was fucked.

So they caught me my dad was the maddest I'd ever seen him I was asked where the key was and I had thrown it in the ditch so I had to lead a cop to go get that then get in the back of a cop car to go to the guys at the boat dock luckily they didnt press charges and I thank god for that. But my dad wasnt having any of it he screamed at me all the way back to the house and I was grounded from my phone for more than a year and even when I got my phone back he didnt buy me service he told me I had to get a job and pay for it myself it has been 3 years or longer and just a month ago I bought service for my phone.

And one last thing the jeep belonged to my big sister best friend at the time so she kinda hated me for the longest time but we good now.

Now to the core of my TIFU, this happened literally yesterday evening and about an hour before posting this so it's all nice and pretty in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday, me and and my mum were having a nice evening snack of pizza, normal stuff. Well we finished up and I was drinking my cool drink like the happy, fat, stuffed idiot I am but didn't realize one critical error I made.

You know it's hot this year, right ? Well I placed this nice table fan right next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

And wouldn't you know it, the cooling, turning, whirling bastard of a fan toppled my bottle and the drink went spilling everywhere, still pretty normal stuff, so I got up and got myself a nice rag and some hot soap water to clean it up since it was sugary.

&amp;#x200B;

All cleaned up, no damage and I'm sipping again, so no biggie, right ?

&amp;#x200B;

**Wrong.**

I woke up feeling only a little stuffed but damn was it nice to finally not wake up because of heat. I did my usual sleepy routine of getting to a toilet, looking into subreddits for a bit and then going for my bathrobe hanging on the balcony, basking in the sun alongside a certain rug that was recently used, and I went to the bathroom about to strip and hop under some nice and cool H2O stream but then...

&amp;#x200B;

*Then I looked down.*

&amp;#x200B;

There was an army of ant storm troopers who decided to make a hideout of my bathrobe and were crawling all over my hand now.

&amp;#x200B;

I picked it up, shook it and got them all out on the ground. *On the clean, well light up, open space.* **It was time for a counter strike.**

&amp;#x200B;

I picked quickly put on my *thongs*, or you know, **flip-flops** for those who use the lesser language, and started having a wild rave-dance-style tap-dance tantrum.

&amp;#x200B;

I gotta say, standing there, seeing about forty or so of those little bastards dead made me feel pretty good but then one realization hit me. *If they were in my bathrobe...*

**THEY'RE SWARMING THE DAMN BALCONY AND HEADING TOWARDS MY APPARTMENTS OPEN DOORS**

throw_away84727462,c9e6en,"Before I start, there are some things I need to describe and clarify so the post makes better sense. I live in a 2 room apartment where a hallway connects my parents' and my room, and at the end is the bathroom which faces the stairs. Halfway down the stairs is my bunny cage and the stairs takes a 180° turn to the other half down to the main area. The halfway part of the stairs is a little area.

This night, I was feeling pretty horny and in the mood and so, I wait for my dad and step mom to fall asleep. I think ""it's go time"", and I get the lube and tissues. As I'm doing the deed, I hear someone come out from my parents room and walk downstairs, so I stop and wait. I deduce it's my stepmom since she has sleep problems and she's been down there a while so I go back to my business. After a while, I finish, but here's my grave mistake: I forgot she was down there. I walk out of my room with no underwear, dick hard just out there, and I walk to the bathroom across the hallway to clean up, thinking that everyone was asleep. I clean up and get ready to go back, but I get this odd feeling, so I check down at the bunny cage, and to what I believed at the moment, saw no one down at the middle area of the stairs. I must mention it was really dark and I'm terribly near-sighted. I walk back to my room, chill out, and put underwear on. A little while later, I get hungry, so I go downstairs to get some food and as I'm going down the stairs approaching the halfway area, I hear a voice in the darkness: ""Are you hungry?"". I fucking flip out and manage to say ""Uhh yeah, I'm just getting cookies"" as thoughts in my head rush through my mind, ""Oh fuck did she see me?"". I think she might've been down there the whole fucking time playing with the bunny. Weird thing too, that also makes me believe she might've seen me is that after I went down the stairs, she put the bunny back and rushed back to the room. As I'm down there I realize I never heard her go back up to the room while I was doing my thing, and in between the time of being in my room and going down for food, I never heard her go out of the room (considering the possibility that I didn't hear her go back up). I'm dying of embarrassment and I'm fucking hoping she didn't see me, and that she was paying too much attention to the bunny. Lord save my soul.

wtfhaymaker,c9p6o3,"So this sucks, it happened last weekend.

I'm a bi dude. I've never indulged  this side of my sexuality for my whole life, but one time I decided to go for it, and I asked the guy to film it. I met my wife shortly thereafter. This was about 7 years ago. And any bi dudes can ascertain, being bi there's an itch that your wife can't scratch. So anyway, she was gone with her mom, sister out to the movies. They never ever come over to our house. I was in the mood and watched the video, got up and forgot it was on the screen. I got called into work, and was using spotify on my phone with my computer speakers and cranked that shit up while I was getting ready for work.

So my wife, her mom and sister got back to my house and wanted to have some wine and listen to music (my computer is right in the living room). So she came over, pressed the space bar and the video of me banging this dude came on full blast on the speakers. I get home from fixing something at work with 3 stunned faces looking at me while they walk out the door.

TheWorstCleric,c9mk35,"**please excuse formatting- on mobile**

Okay, so today I was scrolling through Facebook because I didn’t have anything to do but see a bunch of posts that were going to piss me off. I saw one from a person I had considered a nice friend and a very good work acquaintance from a couple years back saying “If they want to come into this country illegally, they deserve to be put in camps or in prison. I’m all for them handing out that test to everyone and if they pass it, WELCOME TO THE USA. If they don’t, send them back for a year before they can try again. If you don’t want to be in camps don’t come here.”

Boy did that combust my feathers. Along with the post was a screenshot of a Trump quote he made two days ago about us telling them they shouldn’t come here if they don’t want to be in harsh living conditions in these makeshift camps. I get on there and am explaining that if they have that opinion about others that I hope they never get into that kind of situation where they have to choose between their families getting murdered or coming here to live a better life, just to be put in a camp and separated from their families. 

She. Didn’t. Like. That. 
She came back full force saying that her army husband has seen some shit and had he been caught in Afghanistan, he would have been murdered then and there.   -ya. Cause it’s a fucking war zone. I tried going back one more time saying that, and that we were depriving and denying living people of basic human rights. Compared the camps to concentration camps from Nazi Germany (because they’re becoming like that now except these families get to sleep on concrete)

That just garnered her army of ignorant, racist, southern, Trump-humping friends to laugh at everything I was trying to explain and comment further telling me what a fucking dipshit I was and that they deserve prison or worse because they’re iLlEgAl- as if seeking asylum was never a thing. 

I had to go through my friends list and delete a fuck ton of people I thought were sensible but turned out to be trash. 

**TLDR:** 
Commented on a Facebook post that people don’t deserve to be imprisoned and abused for trying to have a better life and ended up bombarded by people who think it’s okay to dehumanize others for being iLlEgAl aLiEnS (aka for trying to come to a place that held a promising future for their families and was supposed to be a better alternative to getting murdered by a drug cartel)",tifu,TIFU by posting a comment on a Facebook post.
NotFWBThrowaway,c8luzt,"This just happened.  My apologies if phrasing is weird, my mind's going crazy and I'm still trying to get this all typed up.  I need to vent my stupidity and don't know where else to post this right now.

This story stars 4 people:  The massive moron (me), one local friend and two people from further away.

The first person: in a long-distance, semi-open relationship with him.  We'll call him Fred.  We have had our rocky situations but we've made things work overall.  I've known him for more than half my life.  We were going to move in together a while back, but unfortunately my parents absolutely detest him and threw enough roadblocks in the process that it had to be postponed.  That's not what this fuckup is about, but it's involved.

The second person: a person about six hours away I share a community with; we've known one another for over 10 years.  We'll call him Nick.

The local BFF/FWB: this was somewhere between a friendship and a friends with benefits situation.  We'll call her Sarah.  We met a few years ago.  HIt it off instantly.  It took me a while to realize Sarah wanted more.  And by took a while to realize I mean missing signals given to me by a country mile.  A while ago, through a slip-up on her end, Sarah had inadvertently let my parents know the feelings of dislike that them and Fred had was mutual, which is what caused those roadblocks mentioned above to get to the point we could not progress further.  Since then, Sarah has been making arrangements and covering for Fred and I for visits as to not be found out, as I know she felt bad about what happened there.

Fred, Sarah, and I have all hooked up and were at least somewhat comfortable as the three of us in the bedroom.

All four of us happen to be rooming together for an event.

Prior to this event, Nick talked to me about finallly being open enough to try something in bed, should we get the opportunity.  Fred liked the idea and said he would keep Sarah busy for a bit so that this could happen.

Fred takes Sarah out to take pictures of some things in the area.  Me and Nick start trying to hook up.  Things are going well.  I thought I heard Fred and Sarah coming back but ignored it.  It really was them, and Sarah definitely saw what we were doing.  Well, the friends with benefits part?  Apparently that wasn't how she was seeing things.  Sarah leaves.  Fred goes to try and diffuse the situation and tells me to stay back.  I eventually can't stay in the room any longer and go looking for them for the better part of two hours.  They come back up to the room.  Sarah says she wants out of the room and called looking for any other accommodations.  Fuck.  Sarah leaves again.  Fred leaves again.  I go to follow, Fred shoos me back again.  Another half hour to an hour.  They come back.  Sarah's not talking to me.  She apparently got another room for some of the days, but not tonight.  I'm on the floor, everyone else is sleeping or trying to.

I have no clue what Sarah said to Fred.  I'm sitting down in the lobby, shaking, crying as I'm typing this out.  The event hasn't even started yet.

To top it all off?  Me, Sarah, and Fred were supposed to have a second week of vacation together after the event, Sarah housing Fred another week on top of that, and being Fred's ride to the airport so no one would know he's here.  I figure there's no way that my parents don't find out Fred is still in the picture, among a lot of other things that will come out into the open depending on just how much Sarah hates me after this.  

If I had been able to see what Sarah wanted, and actually been able to perform in the bedrooom over the last year with her or several years with Fred, or if I had even just had enough sense to say to Nick ""we've got to stop, now isn't the time"", this situation wouldn't have happened.

Pretty sure my friendship with Sarah is fucked, the relationship with Fred ends up getting fucked, Nick and I are just going to be nothing but awkward now, my home life is potentially fucked.

I just wanted to try and make everyone happy and have a good few weeks off but did the exact opposite, to say the least.

I was at a language class and everything seemed so slow, I was feeling horny, so I thought of how I would do it, I couldn't go to the restrooms because for some reason we weren't allowed to, we were also in our P.E. uniforms so that meant if I stood up everyone would see my raging boner. I pressed my left hand upwards under my armchair and let my elbow go just above my shaft, I covered everything with a book held by my right hand. I was just sitting there, starting to feel something, I just planned to edge, but it released, I was shocked, semen started to leak out of my pants. I feel so fucking embarrassed; to make matters worse, my teacher called me to recite a summary of a chapter of a novel. I knew how to summarize it, but with the part of my pants wet, I had to walk to the front of class with everyone looking at me. Don't be like me, and don't try to edge in class.

Weapon3600,c9fs9l,"There's gonna be a lot of backstory, which I will try to summarize. 

I don't date coworkers. In the past, it has only ever gone wrong, mainly because I'm a chump, to be factual. I'm not looking for sympathy on that. That's just the way it goes, and I don't like dealing with the associated office politics. I also don't need a sexual harrasment claim, this is 2019, and I don't want to deal with that. 

So without further ado, this actually happened today, although my perception of time means that it will have been most people's yesterday. 

There's a girl at my work who talks to me a lot. She smiles at me, laughs at my dumb jokes, and constantly makes excuses to put her hands on me. At any rate, we're on a smoke break right before the long weekend, and she gives me her phone number, mainly so that I can give her a ride to work. 

She even told me one time that she wants to ride me. I don't think she meant it in the sexual way, but hey, I'll take all the confidence boosts I can get. 

So I get her number, and I have it today/yesterday, the Fourth. On America day, I do various things to celebrate. I watch the Patriot with my roommates, I watch Independence Day, I listen to fife and drum music with my roommates, I eat a nice steak, and most importantly to this story, I drink. *A lot.*

Now, I hadn't eaten my steak yet, I hadn't actually had anything to eat at all, aside from a jalapeno popper, and like two chicken wings. I had drank half a bottle of rum, and a third of a bottle of this 90 proof whiskey I bought specifically for America day. So as a result, I was super drunk. 

I decided to use my phone and the number I was given to drunk text the girl from work. Everything is going well, I think I'm a fucking genius, but apparently I am not. Apparently I have misread this whole situation and now I have to deal with the fact that I basically asked a coworker out while drunk. I can try to explain it away, but there's only so far you can go and I really don't want to use the whole ""I was drunk"" excuse. 

So now I'm gonna have to see her every day at work and things are gonna be super awkward and there is a chance that people are gonna ask why things are awkward and all the charisma I have at work will be unable to save me. 

tl;dr: I drunk texted a coworker and now might have to deal with a bunch of bullshit. Also, I'm gonna have a huge hangover and an equally huge amount of guilt.",tifu,TIFU by breaking my cardinal rule

I trip over her and scolding hot water splashes all over my hands And falls right onto her giving her heat burns all over her back legs. The water was so hot it actually singed some hairs and made the house smell gross. Now she won't even be in the same room as me.

DatOneFanGirl336,c85h21,"Alright so I’m very nervous about posting to reddit because I’m just worried my post will get taken done for not following rules or something and I’m also very sensitive about how people fell about me. 

But today I was so massively stupid I have to share.

So you know the whole first time poster long time (not really I just come here when I run out of Rslash videos) lurker, mobile device, formatting, yada yada. Nobody cares about my YouTube preferences.

So today I had my twice a year dentist appointment/teeth cleaning. My mom was bringing me and my brother to the dentist and kind of rushing us you know how it is. So I don’t wanna be late (despite the fact going to the dentist is my least favorite thing in the world) and I hop out of the shower and get my clothes changed. I grab my phone and slip on a ring I wear every day. Nothing to sentimental I just like it. 

This was where I f-ed up. 

My fingers are pretty fat. The thing is they’re pretty normal sized until you get between the knuckle and the base of my finger when my fingers suddenly get very fat for some reason. I wear a size ten ring on my right finger (smaller than my left) and that’s pretty big for a young teenage girl. Anyways this ring was a snug fit on my right ring finger but that was the largest size I could get so I stubbornly refused to just not wear it. 

I accidentally put my ring on my left ring finger. Not my right. 

I’m like 68.3% sure that I have worn that ring on that finger before but halfway through my dentist appointment I was fidgeting and I realized my mistake. 

The ring was stuck. 

I pulled a little and this was a mistake because now my finger was super swollen and making it harder to pull the ring off. I texted my mom, she said to sit tight and we would use soap and water, or some lotion she had in her purse. We did just that. 

It wouldn’t budge. 

My grandma picked me up because my brother was still in his appointment and my mom was getting worried. We went home and tried anything we saw, dental floss (that appointment came in handy), ice, soap, oil, more ice, Windex. Anything we had the supplies for we tried, nothing. I listen to good old wiki how and it said if that didn’t work go to a doctor to get the ring cut off. We live in a figurative desert. Our town isn’t even a town. So the only medical...places.(sorry I have a small vocabulary) were a small dirty hospital which was so poorly run we refused to go there, or the local urgent care. We went to the urgent care and quickly learned the urgent care is a big joke. They said they couldn’t help us. At this point my grandma was taking me to these places because my mom has to pick up my dad from the hospital (he’s fine). So my mom called my doctor’s office and they said they could try to help. 

The internet said doctors would have the tools to remove the ring.

The internet lies.

All the doctor could do was oil my finger, and use an ice pack to try and once again slip it off. My finger was SUPER swollen. This was not going to work.

Let me tell you this ring had very painful, sharp edges and corners. every time someone tried to sip it off it just dig deeper into my skin and of course got worse throughout the day. 

My mom meets is at the doctor and my grandma goes home. After the doctor had decided it was not gonna come off without being cut he told us that any fire station should have a ring cutter. My mom called our fire department and nobody answered. So she called the fire department of the town we claim to live in when nobody has heard of whatever you call where I live (I’m dumb enough to get into this mess you’re reading about don’t be surprised I have a small vocabulary) and they answer even though the lady seemed pretty incompetent. She eventually said she contacted XYZ fire department and they would be expecting us. That fire department was downtown and a bit farther then a couple others. We stopped at a different one on the way and rang the doorbell. No response. To be fair we had just seen an ambulance and a fire truck leave so we figured they were busy and went to the ones that were expecting us. We were a little lost but we eventually found someone who helped us out. We sat down in the clinic and in a couple minutes-
FOUR. Firefighters. walked in. They took a look at my finger (the comments I’ve been getting all day about how swollen it is) and got to work with their ring cutter. 

Great they have a ring cutter so they cut it off and you got your finger back end of story. right? 

noPe

The ring cutter was I guess really dull and barely made a dent. It wouldn’t go all the way through and didn’t even make it a quarter of the way before it wouldn’t go deeper. They apologized and said they (surprise surprise) couldn’t help us. We went home. My dad has said he could try cutting it off with a... I’m blanking on the name. 

I’ll try to describe it but it probably won’t be helpful.

So it was a thing (no shit) and it had little box that had the buttons to turn it off and on and it had a REALLY thick wire that went in the wall, the the box, and then out the box to the part that you do the tool stuff with (oh god. I make myself cringe. I’m sorry). So then you held it and  it spun really fast and you could put things on the end and we used a little saw thing. To make an already long and boring story short it worked and I got that damn ring off. 

Extra story of me being stupid later that day: I was complaining to my mom about my lack of a ring now and she said if I was careful with it I could have one of her old rings from high school that no longer fit her. She told me to be careful because it was gold, diamond, and emerald and I had a ring that I may have sometimes carelessly left laying around in the common area of a house with five people, an asshole cat, and two dogs. Never said I was proud of it. I took the ring out to make sure it was the right one and right as she said to be careful, it slipped out of my fingers and fell under the bed. It was just at the edge so it wasn’t lost, it was just funny at the time. I had one job. 

Another extra: I used my unfortunate circumstances to pity my brother into taking me to see the new Spider-Man movie tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks for reading! Have a great day! (My finger feels fine now btw)

Some backstory, there's a girl ive been crushing on for yeeaars, ever since 10th grade. Now this girl and i are pretty good friends i would say, and last night for the 4th she invited me over to drink and watch Supernatural. Naturally, i agreed cuz its her inviting me.

As the night goes on, we both have a good ampunt of drinks in us and then some of her neighbors start setting off fireworks. We went up to the window right next to each other, and watch the last 5 ones they did. Before we could go back to the show, we started making out and one thing to other, we went into her bedroom. 

It was at this point we started getting real dirty and i mean like d i r t y, it was great (maybe this should be nsfw??) Now we were at it for a good hour and a half i would say but because alcohol, i was at my peak performance. I should also mention that we had a condom buuuuuut it was getting real slippery.

By the time i had to get home she was done in for the night but i felt i couldve kept going. Then i thought to myself, ""what if it wasnt the alcohol but i just finished a couple of times without noticing??""  Then i thought ""nah i wouldve known, how can you not?""

So now ive been in an anxious state of mind of whether i did or not and im too scared to ask her if i did... Its a minor fuck up i think, but then again im posting here

HighFivo,ca0ib4,"**There are four important people in this story:**

* A: A fellow employee who I work with
* B: A’s sister, who is also an employee
* C: The son of one of the senior employees
* and I

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

I went on a large vacation to Wisconsin Dells with 20+ other people. This was a work vacation that the boss hosted, and all the employees and their families were invited, including my own parents and sister.

We lived in cabins that were small and had only two bunk beds and one queen-sized, with no bathroom. The bathroom was a shared public bathroom that needed a card to unlock because they didn’t want random people to use the bathrooms I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole day we in the water park, so it helped cool us off from the blistering heat. Except we all got sunburn and suffered without any aloe vera on hand. When we got back it started to rain so had to duck for cover. So we all split up at around 7:30 to get back into our cabins. I was exhausted and started to fall asleep. 

Then my phone rings to life, it’s A. I pick up, half asleep, “Wassup?” Then he spills out his plans to me, “Hey! Me, B, and C are going to shower. But we aren’t gonna really shower. You feel me?” I felt one thing: Sleep. I reply with, “Yo bro I’m so tired… I think I’m gonna pass.” Dejected that I declined his offer A said, “Awww, okay dude. No worries.” I fell asleep, content that I easily rejected drugs and followed those drug PSA’s. They weren’t that addictive lmao. Then I blackout.

I wake up 30 minutes later. Then I call A and say, “Have you smoked yet. Cause, like, I’m down.” Well, I guess Buddha is gonna send me to hell cause I’m doing drugs and I lied to myself. Two sins in less than an hour oops. 

However, A informed me, “Yo okay bet, but your dad is taking a shower so we have to wait for him to leave the shower room.” By now the rain had stopped so I walk outside, feeling super energetic even though I only had a 30-minute nap. So, it’s 8 and A walks out with a can of beer, as usual, and C is sitting by the picnic tables. We congregate and chit-chat. My mom walks over and tells me to remember to shower. This makes A crack up laughing and C to smirk. Way to make it obvious. Mom is confused but lets it go because she is also hyped: turns out she and the other wifeys are all going to hang out! At the casino. When she leaves, A, C, and I look at each other and smile at each other, because now half of the camp will be gone gambling while the other half will get more drunk. It was like as if Buddha forgave me for my sins and allowed me to partake in the devil’s lettuce.

So when all the women leave the men to drink, the three of us escape into the night to smoke a blunt. Now, the plan was to use the farthest shower stall, since it was under the ventilation system and had the most space. But when we arrived someone had it occupied. It was a dent in our plans. Being the mastermind behind this and many previous adventures, he obviously had a back-up plan, “Why don’t we cop an empty tent and smoke in it? It won’t take long so we probably won’t run into someone.” C and I were not for it. A shrugged and went off to hunt down some tents that weren’t occupied. By the time he found one a good distance away from camp, B walked by and asked us what we were doing. We told her our problem and she offered us the safety of the girl’s bathroom. Whatever flags rang through our heads were cut down quick, because she said there was less a chance of women going to use the bathroom since a good 10 of them went to the casino. Whether this was a solid enough excuse or not, we all ran in the girl’s public bathroom to the farthest stall anyways. With a flick of A’s finger, a fire from the lighter, and a blunt being ignited. This was the beginning of getting high. 

Being the closest to the shower I turned it on. It was powered by a button which needed to be pressed every so often to open the water again. As we passed the blunt around and around, nothing has really happened as we barely talked and passed it around. It was like a hot potato, except everyone wanted to hold it the longest, and the potato was weed, not actually a potato. Loving social interactions, I broke the silence and asked A to do tricks, since he was the master. He blew some rings and as if on cue the bathroom door unlocked and opened. We heard a bunch of footsteps walk around and chatter rang through the air as a whole family, a mom and her children, eager to brush their teeth crashed our session. B was shook, C was scared, I was nervous, and A took another puff. He passed it to me and said, “This is Wisconsin, enjoy it.” So I did. We passed the blunt around while I had to press the shower button over and over to pretend someone was using it, I also used my foot to hit the water to make it sound like it hit flesh and not the floor. By the time the blunt was all spent, we were just waiting for the family to move on. In this time I kept the shower on and my feet were still getting bombarded with a torrent of water. 

Now, I kinda suspected that weed took time to set in. And we had time. C was gone again, he went the fastest and was wobbling while sitting down. B and A seemed chill since they were standing, waiting. B especially seemed sober as she would peek out to scout the family every so often, during this time more people walked in so by the time the family left, we had more females to keep track of. 

Lost in my own thoughts, A leans over my shoulder and whispers, “Your feet must be really clean.” I was so puzzled at first, then I looked at my feet. I seemed to have forgotten that my feet were being hit by water for a while now then two-and-two connected and I trying to be sober try to hold my laughter. Except on grunt escapes, and like it was a deep grunt. A, B, and C give me a look of utter shock. I didn’t realize what had happened, then I smiled and turned to A and whisper, “I hate you.” 

Now a good ten minutes later we are waiting for one last female who is still here, then B has an idea. That we should use towels to cover all the guys head to pretend we are girls. Since we are all high as fuck we thought she was Einstein and followed suit. I borrowed B’s towel as she was going to shower for real beforehand, as A and C donned their towels over their heads as well. We opened the curtains dividing us from the rest of the girl’s bathroom and RUN THE FUCK OUTSIDE. By the time we are outside, we split from each other. A and C were going to for real shower now. And I had already showered so I was ready to walk home. As B was going to leave I run up to her and hug her, I gave her a big ole’ hug and say, “Thank you!” She laughed it off and went to the girl’s bathroom. 

Now being high as the Empire State Building, I stood in the dark, right outside the ray of light from the bathroom. So I stood in the dark waiting for the boys to leave. In this time, there was another man who was on his phone. He was looking over at me because I was some random kid standing in the dark to his peripheral. And I may or may not have smelled like weed, so I guess I was scared. 

I took pity on him and sent inside the bathroom so he would be more comfy. I looked into the mirror and see my eyes are bloodshot red. At this point, I realize how high I am. So at this point, there are two people in the showers A and C. I guess and open the curtains to the end of the bathroom. To find A who was about to undress. Obviously shaken, he says, “Yo what the fuck.” I don’t even answer him as I grab his head like they do when they kiss. Legit in my head, I was like I’m not gonna kiss him as I bring our heads closer. I overpowered him but he escaped from it real quick. To make him feel better I said, “Don’t worry I’m not gay. I’m bisexual.” He laughs and says go take a shower. 

Now I was about to follow his advice and go shower but C walks out and I follow him. He is also high as fuck and when he looks at me and smiles and says, “Your eyes are red as fuck.” I look in the mirror again just in case they got redder, and they kinda did. Now he was getting ready to brush his teeth and I had the urge to hug him. So I hugged him. But then I started to spoon him standing up, as he was shorter than me. I put my hand on his abs and pecs and said, “Hmmm, yummy.” He didn’t say anything as he was brushing his teeth. In my head I was like, is this rape? So I let go and went to take a shower.

Now I took off my clothes and started to shower. At this time A has his music blaring. And like being horny and high I did the only thing possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

**NSFW STUFF SO SKIP IF YOU’RE UNCOMFY ABOUT PEEPEES AND BOY HORMONES (ima type the way i thot about it during the time)**

&gt;!I started sexy dancing. Like the ones that strippers do on poles. I was dancing to the A’s music and having a blast in there. It was a whole horny session, where I played with myself and did it to the tempo of the music. Now I grabbed my pp and started beating him up all good, except I was caressing him instead. If sober I was a boss at work, when high I was like a slave. I made pp-sama feel so good and honored. It was like I danced with him. I gave him a personality basically. Then I started to cry because I couldn’t please pp-sama good enough. I cried out loud while holding pp and the wall. I cried my heart out as I couldn’t be good enough. Then I got like hulked out and angry at my pp-sama, now the slave was gone and I was goin dom on my pp. Like I was angry and beating my meat really hard. I was grunting out loud and my fantasies ran really wild. And like it revealed some kinks, I guess. Then I stopped and thought. Is A also feeling lonely? So I opened my curtains and walked out to his shower. I opened it up and stood in the doorway. A was visibly shaken and I didn’t even wear my glasses, I could also tell with my low-level vision that he was also touching himself. He said, “BRO WTF! GET OUT” Now I didn’t leave. I stood there and contemplated asking if he wanted to shower together. Then I was like, maybe he needs his own time. But it made me feel less sad that I knew someone else was doing it together with me so I wasn’t alone. After a while, he left and said, “I’m going, bro.” I almost laughed out loud, knowing I can last longer than him lmao. I kept at is and beat and beat and I made a promise that if I drank my own cum I would be invincible. In the back of my head, I was like, What the fuck no way. Then I swallowed and drank some shower water too.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I was done I was gonna grab my towel to dry up. I went to the place where I hung it. Only to find my clothes. I stood there butt naked staring at my clothes. I didn’t have a towel since I left it in the cabin and borrowed B’s towel beforehand. So now, still high as a giraffe, I had to make a game plan to dry up and get all my clothes. I thought and thought, I didn’t want to get my clothes wet because I liked my clothes. Unfortunately, I had to sacrifice one of them and I chose my pants. I left my hat, shirt, and undies in the shower and closed the curtains. I stuck my hands in my pants to hide my raging boner. My body was wet so my pants stuck to legs and stuff. 

I leave the bathroom and see the same guy who was standing there from before, and I tell him, “Please don’t lock the door, sir. I’m going to come back.” He is also puzzled and in broken English tells me, “Door do not lock. Use key.” True. I begin my trek towards the camp. But I had forgotten my glasses and now the entire place was pitch black. I had to walk with no light, no vision, no underwear, no shirt, and dripping wet. I walked by a whole family and all the kids stopped talking and stared at me (maybe because I couldn’t see their faces), I also saw a flash of a camera. It was a long journey through the dark as I moved around holes, people, and across a road. 

Now I am walking to my camp area betting on my memory and knock on my door. I knock and knock, my roommates who were 10-year-old kids should have opened the door. I start banging harder and harder. I hear my name being called from behind me, it is one of the adults. He screams, “Your cabin is next door!” just as one of the other adults open the door, his eyes still half-shut as I had just woken him up from sleeping. I mutter that I’m sorry and hear the adults snicker and I walk towards my cabin.

The door opens and the kids ask where I was, now I act as sober as possible and say, “Haha! Sorry, I was taking a shower. And I need a towel because I forgot it.” Now one of the kids say, “Didn’t you already take a shower?” Fuck. I forgot that I walked them to the public bathroom hours ago, so I say, “Yes. I did. But I wanted to shower again anyways.” Smooth, real smooth. The kid says, “Okay,” and hands over my towel. Which is still moist from using it not so long before. I walk all the way back to the public bathroom following the same path as before, except before I exit camp my dad calls out to me again, “Where are you going?” I only answer with one word, “Shower.” 

I walk by the same family who obviously recognizes me as the kids are now whispering and I see a few more flashes of a phone camera. I walk on, relishing in my popularity. The guy who was standing there is gone. Except now there is a dad and his son brushing their teeth. I smile at them through the mirror and walk to my shower with all my stuff still there. I walked in and washed my feet. I whispered to myself, “They miss being clean feet.” I put on all my clothes after drying myself and walked out, and almost bumped into the dad who said, “Oh! I’m sorry…” As he looked at my face. I walked away only to turn around and see him open my curtain to the shower looking for probable evidence of smoking. I bolted out real quick. I passed the same family and heard one more flash, I made it camp quicker now that I could see shapes now. By the time I was at camp most of the adults were asleep.

Then I fell asleep at around 2 and awoken to a new day.

Throwaway5020001,c99o3q,"So, this happened on Sunday, I'm on mobile, throwaway, etc.

I've known this girl, let's call her Amy, for a few years. Over this time, we've gotten really close, but never taken any further than a friendship.

Fast forward to Sunday, we go out for a few beers, me, her and her now ex partner (explained in the next paragraph.)

When we all get back to their place, they start to ARGUE. Like, loud, physically violent argument in which the police were called.

I leave during the police visit, when I returned I found that he'd been removed from the property.

Now comes the fuck up.

We sit up all night talking, and after about 2 hours, a few smokes and another beer each, we end up doing the hibbidy-jibbidy.

The timing was awful, but we're both adults, so I thought ""why the hell not?""

I realised before we even started as to ""why the hell not?"" and that's because I've been in love with this girl for around 3 years.

I should have stopped, but by that point it was too late.

Now, it's 4 days later, my head is spinning, it's happened on another two occasions, the latest of which was interrupted by the ex partner. (oh, fuck)

I need to say something, but I wouldn't have a clue how to approach it, especially without her thinking it's all just because of Sunday...

TL;DR - slept with my closest friend, realised I'm in love with her, now can't get her off my mind.

Edit: she broke up with the boyfriend due to the violence and arguments on a consistent basis. Sunday was the last straw, so she threw him out.",tifu,TIFU by sleeping with my closest friend
petenick_1984,c95xhj,"This just happened to me seconds ago. 

So I was enjoying an almost over ripe nectarine. Not having a napkin on me I was licking the juice because it's delicious and I'm too lazy to get up. I see a spot on my palm and continue how I have been by licking it. It looked like a piece of the peel case off too. As it was nearly gone and only bits remained. However, I noticed that it had not been removed. Upon further inspection I notice that it was faded. Peels don't do that. Then it dawned on me that it was my period blood. 

Now I'm not sure which is worse of a fuck up. Just before I had grabbed my nectarine from the kitchen and returned to my seat to devour the fruit, I had used the bathroom.

Today is day two of my period. Which means it's a bloody falls of blood, mucus, and uterine lining. I wear pads because tampons are not friends of my vagina. So in my changing of the pads I had gotten it on my palm. I washed my hands after I had done this but apparently it wasnt good enough.

thefriedeggro11,c8hqd3,"Small FU but I'm sitting here in the restaurant getting laughed at by the wait staff (it's okay, I know them, I'm laughing with them) and I gotta tell someone. 

I just called a small Chinese restaurant and ordered my favorite food. I walked in and had a conversation with the manager (family friend) and talked about my sister and my mom blah blah blah.. so anyway she goes to check on something and this other guy walks in, also seeming to pick up food. 

This super tall guy (I am short gorl) comes up to me and says hi, what's your name, are you meeting anyone here, you're so beautiful, my name's ----, why? Just give me a hand shake... All that. 

I'm uncomfortable and I try to keep my answers short, give a fake name, can't lie and say I'm here to meet someone so I just say the truth that I'm picking up food, very hesitant to shake his hand but I don't want him to act up.

Anyway, my food isn't ready yet but the manager comes back and I pay for it so when it is ready I can just take it but after I pay I just say ""thank you!"" And leave to my car. 

See, normally I take forever to pick up food but today I was early so I wasn't used to paying and then waiting for it here. I just wanted to get out before the guy could make any more moves. 

As I got to my car, it dawned on me. 

I paid without even taking my food. 

I started thinking to myself ""did I take the food?"" ""My hands are empty"" ""did she GIVE me the food?"" ""Am I going crazy?""

So I just waited in my car bc I want to avoid that spooky guy as much as possible and I'd rather not be waiting with him if he's so bold as to come up to me as soon as he walked in.

A minute or so later he came out with his food and left so I went back in. The manager asked where I'd gone and I said I just forgot the food. Whoops. Silly me :)

Now she and her sons are laughing (they work there) and my face is red.

HeavyMetalHeartbreak,c9qslx,"So! This actually was today and is still happening!!

I have always entertained the idea of being a travelling vagabond ever since I found out about that underground culture. It's always been plan B for absolute failure. 

Well, I had a rough breakdown after a failed marriage and left the state when old friends made the offer of a fresh start. 

WELL!!

After about 9 months in the new area I wasn't happy with my job, surrounded by alcoholics, going insane from too much heavy drinking alone, drove my only car off a cliff last week, and was now depending on the guy that owned the shack I was living in to get to work.

This is in the middle of no where. 20 miles from town. 

Have numerous insane instances of almost dying weekly. 

I've had to shoot at packs of starving feral dogs that killed two sheep and attacked a horse. Had to shoot the horse. They don't stop coming. 

Kill one and they multiply. Can't walk outside to take a piss without them threatening to attack sometimes.

Several instances of knife threats, countless fist fights over proving manhood, being shot at, and admittedly did have to return fire a time or two. What can I say? My friends have enemies and I'm in the shit with them. Not what I imagined nor was warned about before moving here. 

Obviously, my life is completely fucked without a vehicle at this point. No freedom. No way out. 

Except one.

 Time to do it. I've had this Alice pack in reserve for 11ish years. I let everyone know where I was going and what I was doing. I spent a couple nights at the creek and happened to tell my dad my plans and that I'll hitch hike in for a visit and camp in the yard or something. 

He has a different idea! Start over again from home, get a job, a car, whatever. Pay for gas and I'll come pick you up. 

Fucking ashamed but not passing up the offer thinking we could go rabbit and dove hunting again, fishing again, and start forging knives again. Maybe start a business. Turns out he bought a really nice property with 15 acres. 

Sweet! 

Dad shows up. Load up what I can fit in his small truck... I thought I could bring my dog... But thankfully there was no room in the tiny cab. This is probably the only thing I didn't fuck up. (I had a good safe home in reserve just in case so Dakota bear is safe!!)

So... We are on the road and he's talking about getting a new roof on the shed. Cool beans. I'll help with that dad! Life talk. Advice. All that. 

We arrive back in my home state I originally left with my now ex wife all those years ago. 

""Let me show ya where you can set up."" 

Starts towards a trail. 

&gt;Umokay.jpg

Through the woods and on the other side of a hill there's a flat spot. 

""It's not a bad spot to build a small house out of the deadfall. And we can build a blacksmith shop over there.""

Alllriiiiight then. That'll be okay. 

""Now if my wife knows about this we will be trespassing on someone else's land and living there.""

&gt;Umwat.GIF

He then goes on to explain about how my step mother doesn't know I'm here and if we are careful she will never find out I'm rebuilding my life in the woods. 

Sneaking out to go to a job and back every day. 

Doing laundry like mischievous kids peeping out the window to see if she's pulling up. 

&gt;Wtfman.img 

He heard her pulling up after some hours of chatting like this is going to work and how the vagabond life should be a rock bottom choice. 

&gt;Iamatrockbottommotherfucker.exe

Off he goes, crashing through the brush, to act like he was working on something in the yard. 

Not long after I have to hear this woman screeching unintelligibly for a few hours. 

She is an immigrant from the phillipines. In truth she's a mail order bride. Turns out she runs every aspect of his life including monitoring his every debit card transaction. He can't spend a damn dollar without permission. Even though he breaks 60-70k a year and both of their names are on the mortgage for this property. Yes she works too. 

So now I sit in a tent on the back side of a hill where I can't build a fire and risk being discovered or my dad will lose everything appearently. Getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. It's hot. Water running low. Pack of yipping coyotes getting closer. Can't find my short sword in the dark. Glad I didn't have to watch my fucking dog die in this shit.

Hitching out at the first opportunity. Already have a destination and someone to meet up with. I have two days before everything comes together for a straight shot there. 

TL;DR - Decided the best option for my life was to be a travelling vagabond. Dad offers better option! Come home straighten your life out! 10 hour round trip for him and 5 hour ride for me only to find out my crazy strict phillipino step mother doesn't know I'm here and I have to hide in the hot ass woods with no way to cool off with bugs harassing the shit out of my skin.  Coyotes gonna eat me soon. Lost my sword. My dad is a slave and he doesn't know it. Going north to meet up with a punk on Monday if I survive. Can't get caught for two more nights.

thisismythrowawayant,c94hqv,"This happened maybe 10 minutes ago and this is my first throwaway account. 

I’m at work and go to the bathroom to take a shit and get paid for it. I start scrolling through Reddit porn and find a really entertaining video so I watch the source, completely forgetting I am connected to the speaker in the store. Big oops. 

Some background info, this store I work in is in a public mall where families often come through and do some shopping. In fact, I had a family with a baby come in about half an hour before this incident. It’s a tourist shop that can get pretty busy. Usually, it’s pretty calm but yesterday (July 3) was extremely busy. Luckily, the mall is pretty quiet today. 

When I left the bathroom and went to reopen the store, I started playing my music again to see if I could hear it from the gate. I could, it was very quiet, but I could hear it. Hopefully no young kids walked by while I was watching porn, they would’ve probably heard it. 

The only reason I know this happened is because I checked my phone’s volume after doing the deed and saw that it was up enough to normally be heard but no audio was playing through it. That’s when my heart sank and I realized I just played porn through a Bluetooth speaker in the tourist shop in a public mall. 

The only good thing? I’m the only employee in the store and I don’t think anyone heard it. It’s possible that it was slightly heard though. I have no idea how loud it was. Nobody has said anything so I’m guessing it wasn’t heard or people are too afraid to say anything. Either way, pretty large FU if anyone heard it.

Scarrock,c94kx3,"Okay so this didn't happen today but I was talking to my mother earlier today and she reminded me of the story. Also, I'm on mobile so pardon my errors :).

So here is a little backstory: I was a 1st grade student at a small Catholic school. After school I went to an after school program that was partnered with my school. We had teachers there who did activities with us and taught us arts and music. My teacher was an extremely nice young blond lady (I'll call her Ms. B from here on.) Ms. B was generally very easygoing and joked around with all of us a lot. On this particular day, it was pretty hot outside, but we got to go outside for free play. 

I am playing in the grass with my best friend at the time Alex, when Ms. B called us all to line up and come inside. We all line up and Ms. B does attendance to make sure that all of us are accounted for. After checking for all of us, she proceeds to lead us inside. We walk up the stairs to head to the classroom. At the top of the stairs is a long hallway, which our classroom is towards the end of. I am in the front of the line with Alex behind me. We pass a door to another classroom and that's when Ms. B asks us a question. 

Ms. B: ""Does anybody have an extra water bottle? I'm pretty tired from being out in the heat for so long.""

The line starts to fidget as everyone looks through their bags for a water bottle. One by one we all answer and say no, we don't have any water. As this is going on, what I thought was a funny joke creeps into my 1st grade mind. What happens next I look back on with extreme embarrassment.

Me: ""I have water Ms. B!""

The line stops and Ms. B turns around to look at me and sees me standing there empty handed. A confused look comes across her face.

Ms. B: ""That's great! Where is it?""

Me: ""Right here!"" I say laughing as I point to my crotch area. 

The whole line starts to laugh and Ms. B is furious.

 ""What did you just say?!"" Ms. B yells and the entire line goes silent. ""Don't you ever say something like that"" she continues. She tells the rest of the class to go inside and I am standing in the hallway with Ms. B, confused as ever. In my mind It was a joke and Ms. B would be drinking pee instead of water. She proceeds to lecture me for about  5 minutes and send me into the time out corner for the rest of the day. When my mom gets there to pick me up. Ms. B pulls her aside and tells her what happened. My mom is just as furious with me and lectures me the entire drive home. I explain to her what I was trying to say as a joke and my mom tells me that I need to apologize. When I get home my mom has me write a note to Ms. B to apologize for what I said. Aftercare was never the same, and Ms. B was never as friendly to me ever since.

yodelinsoftly,c8u4ve,"I'll begin by saying I'm a pretty normal guy, except for this one thing I do. 
        When I was around 8 I started doing 'energy builds' at least that's how I explained it to my sister (we shared a room). I would lay on my bed, perfectly still and imagine all of the energy in my  my room slowly building up, filling me up until I felt like I was about to burst. Once I could no longer contain myself I would let it loose, flopping and flailing around on the bed making strange shrieks until it subsided. My sister is a trooper. 

Well fast forward 17 years I'm living in a predominantly muslim country in Africa and I still find myself doing an energy build from time to time. Only it's no longer in my bed. Most of the time it's after I pass by a window in my house especially if there a lot of people in the street. For some reason this feeling of walking past a window and having to look normal gives me a rush and once I'm passed the window and into a private space I'll let out a short energy burst. 

Today I had just gotten out of the shower and walked past my living room window into my bedroom.
 I felt the rush.
I let it rip. Arms flailing, legs pumping up and down and my mouth puckering like a giant goldfish while making the usual grunts. As I turned about I noticed someone pass by the window. My fan had blown the flimsy curtain aside and I made eye contact with a man as he passed by. He didn't see the whole show but he saw enough.

HikaruJihi,c80jwo,"This literally happened today, hence the ""maybe"" since I have yet to see the fallout, though I believe it is impending. Disclaimer that I will obviously be using fake names, though none of them actually use Reddit.

I [22M] met Ronda [20F] two years ago, and we quickly hit it off because we are very similar in many ways, from our no-nonsense attitude and our overtly friendly nature to our hobbies which include martial arts, musics, generally staying fit etc. I quickly developed a huge crush on her because she is literally everything I look for in a person. However, to my dismay I quickly get shuttled down when I found out from Ronda herself that she is a lesbian. Dejected as I was, I quickly gotten over it and we stayed very good friends, since she is an amazing and interesting person in her own right, and my crush on her really didn't affect our dynamic that much.

For a couple of months towards the end of last year, I didn't speak to Ronda as much, since I was going through a huge depressive episode. I didn't speak to anyone much in general, and instead was too preoccupied with my own mental health and study. So for a few months I had no idea what Ronda was getting up to, but I didn't mind that much, because we were always very low maintenance, with our separate set of friends. But we still know that we have each other's back when we need it.

Fast forwards to new year, Ronda met and started dating her first gf, Angela [21F] who is the friendliest, most lovely and outspoken person I've had the pleasure of meeting. Angela and I quickly became friends.  They're pretty much perfect for each other, as they compliment the other's personalities. If Ronda is strong-willed, energetic and frank, Angela is calm, mature and very kind. I've gone on a double date with them and my gf, and it's clear they love each other.

However, unfortunately, every relationship has its ups and downs. For the time that Ronda and I weren't in contact, a lot have happened. They have already dated for about a month, have a semi-breakup and got back together once Ronda and I got back into regular communication.

Ronda is a lovely and attractive girl, but for every ounce of confident she has around guys, she is as shy and insecure around girls. She is very inexperienced, and Angela is her first relationship, as well as her first sexual partner. It's not that Ronda is conservative (she is very open about her sexuality, in fact) but she admitted that she isn't attracted to many people, and have only ever kissed 2 other girls in the past. This is why when Angela and her first started, the new relationship energy swallowed them up and in that month they saw each other almost every day, and Ronda was neglecting communication with her friends and her degree. Not only that, Ronda and Angela confessed that they love each other (I can't seem to determine who said it first since their account was different and I don't want to pry). Ronda realised after the uttering of the L-word that things were going too fast and decided to hit the hard brake. They decided to take some times off each other, and Ronda took back her L-word, since she thought it was too early to be sure. Angela have told me she was very hurt by this but she understand the reasoning and doesn't resent Ronda. They got back together after the week, and decided the relationship was indeed good and it's what each other needed, though she wanted to go a bit slower. Everything seems good so far right? Here is the catch - Ronda wanted an open relationship.

Ronda is very insecure about the fact that she have had very little experience in relationship, and does not want to commit when she have never slept with anyone else other than Angela. Angela and I agreed that it stemmed from her fear of missing out and wanted to experience more before finally settling down. Angela was very understanding and calm about it, and after some thought and she accepted their new relationship. I was not happy with their decisions, but it was already too late for me to voice any of my opinions of concerns because it had already been about a week since they got back together once i started talking to Ronda regularly again.

So at this point, you might be thinking, why does hikarujihi even think that his opinion might matter? Well, aside from being a concerned friend, Ronda had probably got her idea of an open relationship from me. My gf and I have engaged in ethical non-monogamy for the entire of our 2 years relationship, and Ronda had always said how she admired my freedom. However, I've always been extremely vocal that I don't think polyamory is for her. Having been her close friend for years, I know her personality very well and I know that it's not for her. In addition to that, Ronda has very little idea on how to handle relationships in general, and navigating multiple and maintain good communication is just something you do not jump into, like how one doesn't dive from a 10m board and land in the deep end before one learns to swim. But now that I have came back into her life and is witnessing their new relationship, I chose to show my support because at the end of the day she is my best friend.

After months of calmness and things looking up, last week, Angela met and made out with a girl in a club. It was totally within their boundaries and she told Ronda about it the day after, and at first Ronda was fine with it. However, after getting off the phone call and sleeping on it, Ronda had a breakdown. Apparently she cried over the phone, and she was lost on what to do, and she doesn't quite understand her feelings on it either. I don't know if it's jealousy or the fear of losing Angela, but I know Ronda isn't 100% okay with it, as I have suspected. I took Ronda out to dinner and spoke with her and kept her company and just tried to be as supportive as I can. However Ronda already decided between herself and Angela that she wanted the open relationship to continue, because she fear missing out on experiencing with other people. However, she had restricted it to dates and kisses only, and they cant have sex with other people. Once again I am extremely concerned, and this time I voiced my opinion that it is not a good idea, and she should slow this down and think about it more before rashly jumping to these decisions. I told her again that this might not be for her, and I don't want her to get hurt. But of course, she doesn't listen to me and reassured me that she will be okay, which I also doubt. But in the end, there isn't much I can do, so I kept her company and spent my night at her place, making sure that she is alright.

Fast forwards to the TIFU. I've told Angela I know what happened, and that I don't blame her for any of this, because of course she is not at fault. She asked me if she can call me for some advice and I said yes, naturally. Angela said she have stayed in contact with the other girl, which Ronda knew about, and is okay with it. However, they have just agreed to go on a date tomorrow, which I told Angela that she should inform Ronda ASAP. Angela has very bad anxiety and I know she will have trouble telling Ronda this, so I prompted her saying that it is ok, she isn't doing anything out of line and that she should inform Ronda so that there isn't any complications which Angela agree.

And here is the fuck up, ""is there any concerns you might be having?"" - I asked. Apparently this is the trigger because, to cut this overly long post short, Angela started spilling out her heart to me. She told me she loved Ronda, and that Ronda also love her (which I can confirm is mutual between them because Ronda told me), but their relationship is putting a massive strain on her. Whether because Ronda is new to relationship in general or by thoughtlessness, her messing about Angela at the start of the relationship with the semi-breakup and open relationship are very anxiety inducing. Angela is at a lost of what to do because she knows the open relationship isn't good for Ronda, but she is so stubborn in keeping it this way that Angela can't help but be concerned. However I can understand that is the last thing Angela wanted, because she has a lot on her plate and her mental health isn't at its best rn. She also told me she thinks the new boundary which stop at dates and kissing is stupid, because she thinks the issue is something else entirely and the new boundary would not help, which I sadly agree.

I was very lost. On one hand, I know my best friend is on a one way ride to Hurtville and is refusing to get off, but on the other hand, I want her and Angela to work out because I love both of them and want them to do well, together. I wanted to ask Angela to not see the date tomorrow so badly, but I know it is not my place. I want to tell Ronda about this too, but I know it isn't my place either, and all I can do is be there for Ronda once they have had this conversation tonight. I told Angela that she needed to talk to Ronda and voice all of these concerns because keeping it bottled up with be more harmful to their relationship in the long run. I asked her to do it calmly because I know these kind of conversations can be very emotional and might even be hurtful. I asked her to try and work on their relationship and try to mend it, and maybe put the open relationship on hold to work on trust and security, which is pushing my boundaries, and I know Ronda will be opposed to it. Other than that, I let Angela know that it is not her fault, and that I will be there for both of them once this is done, regardless of the out come.

I wish I have intervened earlier and I wish I have talked Ronda out of this idea. I wish I could take my best friend's side but I can't blame Angela because she isn't at fault, since she had been doing everything in their boundaries. I'm just sad that I'm witnessing their relationship heading in a very bad direction and I don't know what I can do to help. I'm here waiting for Ronda to response to my messages so I can ask her how she is doing.

TL;DR: I somehow planted the idea of non-monogamy into my best friend's head. She won't get off the wild ride despite clearly being hurt by her gf getting with other people. Her gf called me to ask for advice but seems pretty set on how she felt about the relationship. I told her she should communicate her concerns in order to fix this relationship. They're probably talking and people are probably gonna get very hurt.",tifu,"TIFU by inciting a breakup between my best friend and her GF, maybe."
BeeProtector43,c9ia8u,"Ok so I made the song back in like October 2018 but I got in trouble for it today. Essentially the song was just some dumb thing that I recorded for a laugh and shared with just my friend circle. At one point in the song, I said ""this goes out to all my n words"", because I was trying to parody rappers. In hindsight this was a really dumb insensitive offensive thing to do but I didn't intend on sharing it with anyone. However, last night, this kid who had the mp3 decided to upload it to soundcloud and then link the song on his Instagram, where many people saw it. Today, at school lots of people confronted me for it, calling me racist. I've alienated lots of people, including one of my close friends, and it's all my fault. Eventually the principal came and talked to me about why what I did was wrong and offensive. Although I didn't get any formal punishment like exclusion, I now have the reputation as being that white kid who said the n word. Upon leaving school, this boy came up to me and started filming me with his phone, calling me racist. So many people are pissed off with me and I think I'm absolutely fucked when I return to school on Monday as people have threatened to beat me up.

Houston didn’t have time to prep the launch pad, so I landed and quickly fired off once more.

But I faced turbulence as I ascend to what I hoped would the the heavens!

But instead I fell all the way down to hell, a hell which involved an ankle and a window.

Turns out my landing gears weren’t deployed properly, this meant that 259 lbs of pure neck beard, slammed down onto the spindly ankle that was used to 10 hour hardcore gaming sessions not autoerotic space flights.

I went to the fridge to get a Molson Canadian and it really hit me how bored I was and how some of this boredom is due to past fuck ups where I totally lit a friendship up in flames (as Eminem would say I tied her (the friendship) to the end and lit the house on fire).

Myst3rySteve,c9u3uo,"I kind of fucked up in a way similar to if you were giving a speech at a church and ended it with ""So you be the best you you can be, god damn it!""

(also, for the record, I do not participate in the lack of fapping, I was just morbidly curious to see what that world looked like)

So what happened was I saw a post that was a screenshot from a post on one of Terry Cruise's social media accounts explaining the importance of saving yourself from porn in general. The only problem I had with this was that he basically talked about pornography as if it was all about demeaning and promoting aggression and all that stuff.

The only thing I thought to do was to help and explain (in a calm and respectful manner) in a reply to this post that that's only a vocal minority of all pornography out there and there's a good hefty amount of porn out there that's healthy, promotes well being in all those involved, can even be educational, meditative, relaxing, self-healing and a bunch of other good fun healthy stuff. There's only one thing I forgot not to do.

You see, I've been in my fair share of civil debates that were handled with care, respect and professionalism where necessary, so I'm accustomed to taking a certain amount of precautions when trying to make a point. One of those ways is providing an example of a place or person or thing that you can find that demonstrates what I'm talking about to be true. 

The only way I could think of doing this was to recommend my favourite website (that I'm not going to link to here, but I will specify it's an audio-centered site) that not only provides an arousing experience, but also promotes men's health (and health of your partner) and makes sure never to include anything in their work that's demeaning to anyone unless it's made clear that they really do want that.

In doing that, I completely forgot that even just mentioning a porn site by name in a manner indicating I'm recommending it is cause for a ban in the rules list.

Whoops.

I’m at work and my manager sends me on my 30 minute break and first thing I do is call Riley so we can talk. We almost always talk during my breaks. Anyway, the conversation goes something like this:

“Hi, I’m on my break. What’s going on?”

*”THEY’RE GONNA PUT DOWN SMOKEY! :’(*

Smokey is her 19 year old cat with tumors and shit, blind in one eye and can’t hear shit and was hit by a car twice. Basically, Smokey shouldn’t be alive but the motherfucker was (metaphorically) still kicking. Her grandparents were taking Smokey to the vet to put him down (for obvious reasons) and she doesn’t think it’s right. I’ve seen Smokey and I would’ve put him down 4 years ago, he’s dead in all forms except literal. Bitch cat used up his 9 lives already.

“Who? Who’s putting him down, your grandparents?”

*”Yeah, they think he should be killed.”*

A bit dramatic but whatever.

“Well, Riley, he’s an old cat. He’s 19, blind, and not well. I think they’re making the right decision.”

There’s the fuck-up. I made the wrong decision to say they were making the right decision.

*”What!? Smokey is fine, they’re killing him because they don’t want him anymore! Are you saying they should kill my cat!?”*

“I mean... if it’s the right thing to do, then yeah.”

Rage engage

*”WHAT THE FUCK, u/THEBAKERYISOPEN!? HE’S MY CAT, THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS...”*

I moved the phone away from my ear, she’s loud. Then, I quietly said “just kill the damn cat” and she heard it.

*”What did you just say? KILL THE DAMN CAT!? Smokey is the best thing that’s ever happened to me (wow thanks) and you want him to die!? FUCK YOU, I DONT WANT TO SEE YOU ANYMORE! WE ARE DONE!”*

And she hung up on me and blocked my number. Power move. I was a little shocked than angry or sad at first that she dumped me right then and there but after telling my coworker what just happened, he said we should’ve broken up because she was batshit crazy anyway and he didn’t like her too much.

TheFrenz,c8r4sy,"First time posting here, also it happend about a week ago, english is not my primary language and i m on mobile so bear with me if there is some mistake.

First of all a bit of context.
 1- My father and uncle came to visite me like 3 weeks ago and when they left they took one out of my two set of keys, they've mailed it to me but to this day i m still to receive them.
2 - I had asked for a paid leave for last monday, wich was accepted, but since the company i work at is kinda under staff they asked me if i could still come on monday and that it didn t matter if i was late (I went at a festival in Paris and work in south France) and i said ok.

Now to the actual FU, as mention above i was at a festival in paris with some friends, it was great and on monday morning i had to take a train back to where i live so after having slepped for like 3 hours I woke up at 6:30 AM at my friends place, took my stuff while making as little noise as possible and headed to the train station. I got in and at 8AM the train left. No problem so far.

I was chilling in the train until my co-worker called me around 12:30, apparently nobody had told him that i was gonna be late and he wanted to know where i was since he was waiting for me to arrive so he could leave. I explained to him that i was suppose to be on leave but i m coming anyway only a bit later, then during our conversation my phone died.

No biggie i think to myself, i m almost at my stop, i go to my appartment, take my car keys and i ll be at work in no time. And then it hit me, did I took the keys to my appartement? I m nervously searching in my backpack, nothing, i search though all of my stuff, fucking nothing. Great now i have to call a locksmith, change my lock and i cannot tell anyone cause my phone died and i couldn t recharge it in the train. Thankfully a kind lady saw that something was off and after explaining to her my problem she gave me her external battery. 

I managed to call my boss, I ,once again, explained my problem, he laugh at my obvious stupidity and says that he understand and it is ok. 

At 13:00 I got off the train and headed towards the location agency to get a magnetic to open the door of my building. it was close until 14:00 ... Great no i have to wait 1 hour. In the mean time i call a locksmith and we agree to meet in front of my building a 14:30.

Once the agency open i ask for a magnetic key. They have some but i have to pay for it upfront, sure i tell them how much? It is 16€ but they only accept cheque the problem is my chequebook is in my appartment. This day is definitively getting better and better. In the end the were nice enough to let me leave with the key and asked me to go pay for it once my door is open.

At 14:30 I meet with the lock smith we go to my door he inform on the price, 120€ to unlock it (not including taxes), fucking expensive but what can i do. He break the lock and open it in like 5 minutes then ask me if i want my lock changed, once again i ve got no choice so i say yes, 150€, the bastard has no shame, but i have to do it but then he tell me that he only takes cash. In the end it costed me 313.5€ cash mind you wich of course i don t have on me because let s be honest who travel with that much money nowadays. I let him work on my door and go to the cash dispenser, there is one 100 meter away from me. I put my card in it ask for 300, everything is going normaly, it give me my credit cards back and tell me that my cash will soon follow. I wait, 20 seconds, 30s, 40s, 1 minute nothing come out and i m like wtf,  really? So i try again and now it tell me that it can give me my money cause it is to damn much. 

I lost it, i just strated swearing to the machine for like 2 minutes, so far it was the best motherfucking day ever. I call the locksmith agency again told them that the man working on my door only wanted cash, that i could not pay him in cash and that i will not do it. They said that they were sorry the worker said that, that he will of course take cheque, and they will call him once he is done and put him back in his place (it is totally forbidden to ask for cash only in case you don t know it mean that he will take the money and put it in his pocket so the state does not take his share) 

I went back to my appartement he was done changing my lock i told him that i could not pay him in cash and it will be cheque or nothing. He was not happy, the ass strating to ask me why not, that 313 was not that much money and that he did not undertood why the machine did not let me ask for this much. I was pissed enough as it was, i let him know a piece of my mind, told him that 300 was indeed a fucking lot, that cash dispenser did not let people asked for that much at once and that if he started using it once in while instead of ripping people off he would know it. He was not happy with me. By the time he did the bill it was 15:00. In case you did not notice it he work for 30 minutes and asked for 300 buck that s 600 an hour even a lawyer would not charge this much, no one does. This fucking crook

A bit after he left my co-worker called me and asked if i had gotten my shit in order; we talked for a bit (he made fun of me for being a dumbass ofc) and since he was at work since 5:00 I told him that will come so he can leave, i take my car key go pay for the magbetics key, then head to work, by the time i arrive it is 16:00 i try to get some clean working clothe but the laundry at work was closed, i had to wear smelly dirty clothe ( it has been really hot in south france lately like 40°C) until i finished at 20:00. 

No need to say that i did not like my day.

The voice recording thing built into my texting app is very strange. And I guess apparently it records me without my consent? Because I definitely did not ask it to record me when I was being a dumbass in front of my mirror in my bedroom.

Maybe it's because I'm still young and an idiot, but sometimes I like playing out little skits in front of the mirror. And of course this was one of those times. I'm standing in front of my mirror, having a back and forth conversation with myself about some made up secret society, without realizing my phone is recording everything I say.

But that's not the end. God I wish that was the end of the recording. But of course not. Then I begin to talk about how good I think I look. And I quote, ""Why do I look so good in this mirror? Damn, and it's only in this mirror too! It's gotta be the lighting. Ooh, I look SO good!""

I sound like a complete dumbass. Luckily at that point I leave my room and the rest of the recording after that is silence. But the first couple of minutes are a gold mine of cringe.

I had a drama performance at my school that night, so I had my phone with me but I didn't check it or turn it on for the next hour or so. Once my part was done with, I went into the audience to watch the other performances and turned my phone on. I was extremely confused to see a 13 minute recording I didn't remember sending in my text history with my crush.

I put the speaker up to my ear but I couldn't hear anything and was afraid to turn it up and disturb anybody around me. So for the rest of that hour, I had no idea what the fuck I had just sent my crush. I was hoping it had just been of the performances, or even of me practicing my lines before. I wasn't too worried.

That was until the performances ended and I could hear the recording clearly. My heart stopped. Of all the things that could have been recorded that night, it had to be of me talking to myself. I was horrified. I was sure that my crush was going to stop talking to me right then and there. I felt like such an idiot. I was mad at my phone for doing all of this without my consent or even without me knowing. I wanted to go dig myself a hole, curl up in a little ball, and rot away.

Luckily, this story has a happy ending. My crush took it really well and didn't stop talking to me. In fact, now she's my girlfriend.

I meet an attractive, personable dude working at an establishment. We chat awhile during the evening and decide to hang out after they close to grab a drink elsewhere.

Radiantlyred,c9diyt,"This happened roughly 2 hours ago. I’m still in agony. Sorry for the format, I’m on mobile. Also if your squeamish with blood, maybe you shouldn’t read. TL;DR

Me and him both got off a few hours ago. I’m staying at his place so when we get there we both get naked and head to the bathroom for a shower. Everything is going good. We are scrubbing each other down and rinsing off the suds. 

So he’s finished and I decided to do my lady bits really quick because I know we are having sex and it’s been 2 days since I’ve shaved (seriously contemplating never fucking shaving again). I’m trying to do it quickly, he’s still in the bathroom drying off and I didn’t want him to catch a look at me doing it. (Idk, just not an attractive thing to look at) I have the razor in my right hand and with my left I kinda stretch my skin at the V in your leg between the thigh and vag. This is all happening very quickly and I take the hand with the razor and drag it across the start of my pube hair line. 

EXCEPT IT WASNT MY FUCKING PUBE HAIR I CAME DOWN ON. IT WAS MY PINKY NAIL.  I felt it instantly. I didn’t freak out, I thought quietly “Fucking damn it”. I’ve done it before once or twice in my years. Usually not that bad. But then I looked. Then i rinsed the blood and really saw what the Fuck I had just done to myself. I took a WHOLE CHUNK from my nail. Like it’s all gone. There is skin where my nail is suppose to be. And blood. And lots of pain. 

I started whimpering like a lost soaking wet dog. He was trying to ask what was wrong but I was too embarrassed and In too much pain. So he’s staring at me, naked. I’m staring at him, naked and whimpering. I don’t verbalize actual words for minutes. He started to get annoyed because he didn’t know how to help me. He turns the water off, helps me out and drys me off. 

He pours peroxide on it and I shamefully tell him what happened and what I was doing. He looks away, shakes his head and then laughs. God I’m in so much pain. He helps me get dressed and walks me to the bedroom. We had plans to have sex but also watch stranger things and eat Doritos. He opened the Doritos and sat down and held my hand. After a few minutes I started crying because of the pain and he looked and saw, he then fed me Doritos in between feeding himself so I didn’t have to let go of his hand. 

He doesn’t own and bandaids so originally I had to use toilet paper. I didn’t want to because I knew that it would soak and clump like toilet paper does. We are about to go to sleep (yeah, that’s a no-go on the sex too) and I got up the courage to take the toilet paper off and it was Fucking stuck. I had to soak it in water to get it off. Right now I’m grinding my teeth, preparing for bed not knowing how long I am going to be in pain and in fear of hitting this finger on something. 

TL;DR: trying to shave my vagina without my fwb seeing, went too fast and shaved a whole chunk out of pinky nail. Never got to have sex and got toilet paper stuck to it.

London_Connection,c8awy4,"Mandatory disclaimer: this actually happened yesterday. 

So I work on a rotation out in the middle-east (I'm from the UK originally though) on an industrial project. In our expat office there's about 80 guys and all of 4 women. 

As it's an industrial site the first thing that happens in the morning is everyone gets changed into their PPE (coveralls, boots etc). However there's only 3 male changing cubicles on the site, so it's an unofficial rule that all the guys just get changed at their desks (there's a little divider on each desk for a bit of privacy) first thing while the women get changed in their changing room. 

Yesterday morning started no different. I got in  whipped my t-shirt off and had just got my second leg out of my trackies when I heard one of my female colleague shouting on me. I tried to quickly straighten up to grab my coveralls and partially cover myself out of decency. However in the process of trying to do it so quickly one of my boxer legs partially rolled up my thigh and got stuck. 

It was one of those horrible moments when time slows down, I could actively feel the boxer leg roll it's way and get wedged and, even worse, I could feel the best part of my pride and glory was fully exposed and stuck to my inner thigh. 

Just as I'd managed to process what was happening and what was on display she turned the corner of my desk and stopped dead on the spot. 

She said ""Oh"", blushed, and said ""Oh my, easy there tiger"" before turning on the spot and leaving. 

To make it even worse there were a couple of witnesses around who saw the whole thing from start to finish. Needless to say the rest of the day was pretty horrendous and I'm pretty sure that the nickname 'Tiger' is going to stick for life now. 

On the plus side she saw the humour of it all and had a laugh with me about it afterwards.

I didn't want to seem rude by asking him the price of the watch, but needless to say, I searched up the watch a few days later. I was shocked to find that the model he bought for me was worth a lot of money, [CAD $62,128](https://www.chrono24.ca/audemarspiguet/royal-oak-lady-37mm-frosted-18kt-white-gold--id10273927.htm) to be exact.

Fast forward to a few days ago, me and my watch (my wife came as well) went to Canada's Wonderland, which is like the Canadian version of Six Flags. On one of the rides there called Wilde Knight Mares, my hands were placed in a really uncomfortable position to wear my watch. Luckily, the ride provided a pouch for small items. At the time, I thought it was super convenient and placed my watch in there, swearing that I'd remember to pick it up after the ride (I know I'm very stupid).

By some means, I forgot about my ridiculously expensive watch and continued leisurely strolling around the park enjoying my day. About an hour later, I almost had a heart attack when I remembered that my watch was missing. I panicked and told my wife that I had to go to the bathroom (she didn't notice the watch was gone). I turned the corner and immediately started sprinting back to the ride where I had lost it. I started frantically explaining to the ride operator what had happened. She let me check the pouches of every single one of the carts. Alas, it was nowhere to be found. I filled out one of those lost and found forms, knowing damn well that the watch wouldn't turn up. I returned to my wife, and we headed home soon after.

So that was a few days ago, and ever since then I've been in a paranoid state of mind, panicking whenever my wife started a conversation. It's all I've been thinking about for the past few days. I have not the slightest idea about how I'm going to break the news to literally anyone I know, let alone my wife, and I'm very nervous about my wife noticing that the watch is missing. I need to get this off of my chest before anyone finds out, and if anyone has any suggestions, those would be nice as well.

TL;DR: I lost an extremely expensive watch that was given to me as a wedding gift at an amusement park.",tifu,"TIFU by losing my $50,000 dollar watch that was given to me as a wedding gift."
iMagicBae,c83jra,"This didn’t happen today exactly but it was today that I remembered the events that occurred that afternoon when i was 12 years old. 

We all get to that playful point after figuring out what masturbation is where we start to explore and expand our knowledge about how to make ourselves feel better. I must have been around 12 years old and a few months into masturbating when I heard about lube. Being 12 years old it would’ve been hard for me to get any and I didn’t have the confidence to ask my parents for lube to go pursue my newly-found favorite hobby, that is assuming they had any to begin with. So I started experimenting with liquids. First it was water; masturbating in the shower felt much better than on my bed late at night. Some days i would even take two showers in a single day. Within the showers themselves I moved on to soaps and shampoos which felt great but I had a desire to keep increasing my range of available “tools”.

At some point it got pretty weird. If I was home alone I would sneak into the bathroom with some ketchup, mayonnaise and even toothpaste once or twice. I would rub it in there, seal the deal and wash it all out. This didn’t become a fetish or anything, I was legitimately just figuring out what would work and feel best. The real trouble began when I found out about some creams my mom kept on her room. I tried some of these and they worked like a charm. My favorite was a coconut oil one that she had meant to treat hair. But I was in this quest to find the best cream so I had to keep expanding my knowledge, so I kept trying different creams. Now, being that young I didn’t really care or read what the creams were for. I came across one that, until this day, I don’t know exactly what it was meant for and it’s effects didn’t make themselves present immediately so i didn’t bother to read it after this demonic ointment made life for a few days miserable.

Bear with me as I try to be as descriptive as possible on the effects this cream had on my nuts. They became a bit swollen and looked a bit dry. They looked brittle (though they weren’t, obviously) and they had the consistency of a piece of cardboard only within the first few seconds of dropping water on it. It didn’t hurt at all but i was scared as FUCK. For some reason this thankfully didn’t spread to the rest of my wee-wee, just the testicles. It lasted for about 3-4 days. For those 3-4 days I was traumatized contemplating how my life would be over and how I would stay a virgin for the rest of my life because, lets be real, nobody is going to fuck the guy with the crystal testicles. On those first few days I was on the edge of telling my parents, but on the morning of day 3 the effects started going away and my nuts were slowly going back to their normal shape and size. Today they look perfectly fine, work perfectly fine but im still a virgin. 

TL;DR: My nuts had a weird reaction to cream I stole from my mom to masturbate with when i was 12 years old.",tifu,TIFU by dehydrating my testicles trying to figure out masturbation.
Flame2216,c8ktgm,"Sorry for any grammatical or formatting errors. This is my first time posting a story on here.

This happened about 18 years ago when I was 18.

I at the time was living with my than girlfriend and we both worked at her family's restaurant. 

One day she was driving us to work. From her house to the restaurant takes about 25 minutes. Halfway during the drive I'm feeling a little horny so I grab her hand and put it down my pants. She is reciprocating so i unzip and lean back in the seat and enjoy the ride. She is driving with 1 hand while playing with my mini me with the other. 

As I'm about to finish I lift up my shirt as to not get anything on my work uniform. Upon completion I look around the car for some napkins to clean up but can't find any. I look in my GF's purse and no napkins or tissues to be found either. But I do find 1 of her pads so I'm like fuck it and I use that to clean up. After I clean up I look around to see if any cars are around and when there is not, I toss the pad loaded with my little soldiers out the window.

Continuing our drive to work, people that would pull up next to us would be smirking/laughing but I had no idea why. Did they possibly see what was going on earlier? I really doubted it. Did they see me throw the pad out of the window? I dont think so because I didn't see any cars around. 

Once we arrive to the restaurant I get out of the car and close the car door. Something catches my eye near the rear back passenger door. On closer inspection I find out that it's the damn pad I threw out the window and it got stuck to the car! We were driving for about 10 minutes with this thing just flapping in the wind. I let my GF know what happened and she just starts cracking up.

Moral of the story: Don't litter.

TL;DR Got a handjob from my GF in the car and used 1 of her pads to clean it up. Threw the pad put of the window amd it stuck to the car.",tifu,TIFU by using my (ex)girlfriend's sanitary pad
throwAjue,c8z858,"This is a long and heartbreaking story for me, I just wanted to tell it and hopefully get over it soon.

My roommate, Tyler we shall call him, he is 35, works in a factory and drinks 12 beers a day. I am 29, bartend, and I enjoy a couple of joints or whatever throughout the day. Maybe a few beers. Ok, so Tyler meets a girl named Andrea after he gets heartbroken by a girl of his past. So Andrea and him hit it off for a month or so and Tyler's birthday is in August. Andrea messages me and asks if I can help her get presents and make Tyler's day fun. So I get a cake, cupcakes, ice cream, presents, a birthday card. The whole 9 yards. After his birthday, Tyler asked who bought his presents and found out it was me who did everything. I guess Andrea was supposed to make it the most unforgettable bday party for a man that is 15 years older than her.

Forgot to mention that. Andrea is 20 years old, born here in USA, moved back to mexico when she was 8 and moved here when she was 19. She knows limited English and I took 4 years of spanish and have practiced since. One day before Tyler's birthday we were downstairs having fun and Tyler couldnt understand what Andrea was saying while they were dancing. She wanted him to assume the position of whatever mexican dance we were doing.. Anyway she points at me and tells me what to do.. A very pretty girl, telling me to put my leg in between hers and grab her by the waist. From that moment I fell for her. I didnt know what to do so I just enjoyed it. I feel there were connections between us on multiple occasions. However we will get to that.

So Tyler tears up his birthday card at Andrea and his workplace. (in front of her and other employees) Continues to act like a child and treats Andrea like absolute shit. I talked to Andrea daily from his birthday and I found her to be a very caring and a nice person. Tyler has been my friend for 10 years and I couldnt see why he could hate her so much.

Tyler finds out that Andrea and I are facebook friends and have messaged eachother. He tells me that I cannot message her or talk to her in any form. I thought that I could hide talking to her and he would eventually get over it.

After a month or 2 Andrea begins to ask me to do little favors for her. I agree and I start helping her with paying her phone bill, sending money to her family, Next I begin to take her to work, and sometimes home from work when she would stay late.

By the time Christmas rolls around I had helped her with many things and considered her to be a very valuable person in my life. Tyler and Andrea saw eachother at work obviously and Tyler kept saying how hard it was to work with her. I told him he should quit and find another place, not because of her, but because of other problems he had also told me about as well. Well he ignored all advice and continued to stew about Andrea.

January and February roll around and I am still talking to Andrea. Helping her out whenever she needs it. I just wanted to spend time with her. Finally, someone from Tylers work, who also happened to be a former girlfriend of his, saw Andrea and I go to an Electronics store and buy a phone with her.

Andrea knows I have feelings for her but wants me to keep them secret. She says that she doesnt want a boyfriend, so I agree to keep everything secret. I lied to Tyler and said that someone brought Andrea and I coincidentally walked into her there. 

Andrea had lost all trust with Tyler at this point. Tyler was still affected by her prescense but by this time ""had to go to therapy because of her"". Even though I saw him while we partied everynight downstairs and he would talk to other women and tell them how he loved them.

So March is coming around and Andrea wants to go to Mexico to see her family and meet her sisters baby that is about to be born anyday. I helped her get her passport back in November, so all we had to do was get her plane tickets. We booked them and then her Sister had her baby. She needed 1000$ to send immediately. She asked me for that money and I told her I would gladly give it to her. Andrea paid me back in a few days or a week.

Andrea and I had another encounter with Tyler's ex girlfriend when we went to the mall. She saw us when we were shopping for things Andrea was going to bring back for her family. We were there for 6 hours that day, I am sure she saw us multiple times.

So her trip date is coming and she asks me if I can take her to the airport because nobody else can. Its 3 hours away and I am madly in love. I can be the last person she sees before she goes back to her family! So she doesnt know you have to pay for luggage early, I did it for her in the car. I gave her 200$ cash before she left in case she needed it. Money becomes part of the norm and I am thinking she might dig me. She tells me how she wants me to go with her.

I cried as soon as i got to my car. I talked to her every minute I could while she was there. She asked me to pick her up on Monday. I said I would. She missed her flight. Cool. I still have tomorrow off. I will get her.

So all this time I am making up excuses as to where I am going with Tyler. I do not know what I said about going to take her to the airport but I probably said I was going to my parents.. So Tyler finally comes out and says that he knows I took Andrea to the mall and that I am still talking to her. I lied again about how much we actually talked.

So Andrea gets back from Mexico, She still owes me the 400$, we are eating lunch and I am helping her with things as she needs. I am in the process of looking for a house because Tyler and I's situation is getting worse and worse. She still has feelings for Tyler and Tyler begins to win back her trust.

3 weeks ago I went to lunch with Andrea and we talked about if she had any feelings for me at all. She said no. She insisted she still doesnt want a boyfriend. She can only offer me a friendship. 

Tyler begins to post pictures on Facebook and Instagram about Andrea and him eating lunch. Tyler bought her flowers and is back in her trust ring. I deleted Tyler and Andrea from Facebook. He treated Andrea like shit and I just want to forget all of this.

I love her so much and I know things will never be the same. I gambled everything on her because I thought I was the perfect guy for her.

To this day, Tyler has no idea how much I have done for her. Or how I truly feel about the whole Andrea situation. I dont know if I should tell him or not. But my gut tells me to just move on with my life.

If you read all of this, thank you. There are still many details remaining but none of this matters anymore, I just wanted to vent. Thank you.

TheIntLobo,c9oc90,"This happened this afternoon while my parents were out shopping for some furniture. My parents are pretty conservative, but are not opposed to toys and such. However this fuck up is pushing it.

One of my favorite snacks is babybel cheese. It's not because of the taste, but because of wax that the cheese is covered in. http://imgur.com/gallery/8Jo3ssQ is a picture of the product if anybody is unfamiliar. Each cheese portion has a wax coating around it that you have to remove before eating the cheese. I always take that coating and play with it like play doh. 

Every time I ate some cheese, I would save the wax to play with and add it to my collection. After about 2 weeks of saving up the wax, I had a sizeable amount of wax to play with. This was all fun until my horny side decided to take over decision making. I decided to mold the wax into a dildo and stick it in the freezer so it could harden. I then took some butter and used it as lube. It wasn't the best, but it did the trick. I stuck my cheese wax dildo up there, and it was pretty nice. I decided to take the dildo to the rear end to see how it felt.

This is where the fuck up begins. The wax only stays hard for so long. After some time it deforms and breaks apart into pieces. So as I was putting my creation into the shit hole, a part breaks off into my ass and I panic. I try to pull it out, but I end up pushing it further in. So I eventually calm my self with the red wax stuck in the depths of my asshole. I call my parents and tell them to get their ass home there is a ""medical emergency"". My parents drop what they are doing and rush home. They tried to ask me what was wrong, but I just hung up and refused to pick up any more calls. My parents made their way home 25 mins later and I had to nervously explain why the hell there was red wax in my ass. 

My dad had the ultimate wtf expression on his face as my mom got most of the wax out. At this point the wax was softer and could just be scooped out. It felt tingly but painful at the same time. After this whole situation was resolved, my parents were pretty pissed. 

Since that incident, I have taken a nice dump and the remaining wax made its way out. Hopefully a few more cycles and I can go back to normal.

patoooo20,c9qlk2,"This started 3-4 days ago, but the repercussions were felt today.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friend and I were playing an ARAM game on League of Legends (irrelevant but just wanted to put some context to those who play LoL). So there's another friendly duo and some random and the duo jokingly ask for our phone numbers so we can chat. Now I know absolutely 100% that my friend is looking for my number right now and will type it, so instead of asking him not to do it I look up his and type it first. Indeed one of them starts texting us and she (I guess?) seems nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that I start getting spammed hard with phone calls from my city. I think someone from the game posted something on Facebook telling them I was a hooker or something (apparently her name is Luz). I have gotten like 80-100 calls in the last few days. I was hoping the calls would die down but no, they are still calling today. I just block them and put my phone on 'Do not disturb mode'. It does not ring anymore, but I get a popup screen every time someone calls (pointless?). The real tragedy (unless I get kidnapped or murdered somehow) is that I was playing this game on Facebook Watch where you answer 10 multiple-choice questions to win a part of the prize (if you answer them all). The prize today was 100k USD so I was hyped up.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, guess who makes it to the 10th question. My heart was racing so hard because I knew the prize would be quite big. So the 10th question comes up, and it was something like this: 

&amp;#x200B;

""What was the original language of the New Testament?""

&amp;#x200B;

Suuuuper easy question. You can even Google it in less than the 10 seconds they give you and it pops right up (the answer is Greek by the way). Some douche decides to call me right as the question pops up. I manage to close the popup, but it was too late. Didn't answer in time and lost in the last question. Each winner took home around 240 USD..which really would have helped a lot. Going to change my phone number tomorrow.

NoSkeet,c8x1jt,"This all went down about 10 mins ago. So my girlfriend and I have been together for 6 months as of 2 days ago, and we decided to have nice dinner date to celebrate. Everything went according to plan and we had a wonderful evening. On the way home from dinner we made a pit stop at the grocery store to pick up some whipped-cream for a pie we had baked earlier, of course I had to make the joke of wanting to put it on her nipples and lick it off later, she laughed and said “If you’re a good boy”. Not sure if it’s just us or a couples things but we always talk like children to each other and throw fake temper tantrums, it’s just as weird as it sounds trust me. So we arrive home and I head to the washroom for my post dinner #2 while my SO cleans the kitchen. Several minutes later I emerge from the throne room and expect to find my SO in the kitchen but she is nowhere to be found, must have scared her off with my stench. So I head upstairs looking for her and to my surprise she is laid out on my bed with a whipped-cream smiley face drawn out on her chest, to no ones surprise sexy time ensues and things heat up quickly, I took her from the bed down to the kitchen to spice things up because we usually don’t have the house to ourselves due to my roommates lack of social lives, All is well.... until my SO starts to worry my roommates might return while we were in the middle of our sinful activities so we head back upstairs to the hallway where we can retreat quickly if interrupted. Things are going well once again.. or so I thought. This next part needs a little explaining so you can picture the events that follow. We are sinning doggy-style against a wall so in order for me to assist her climax I have to reach around and down with my hand whilst thrusting, this normally isn’t a problem and it works quite well. Unfortunately for me I got a little ahead of myself and I slipped out. This also normally isn’t a problem but I regularly neglect cutting my finger nails so when I slipped out and thrusted forward my nails scratched the tip of my Penis, this caused me to shout in pain while also completely killing the mood.

doboppitybeepboopbop,c88opy,"This wasn’t actually today, but it’s been a recent realization I have to vent about. 

Twenty years old and I’d never masturbated, never had sex. I’d gone to second base and enjoyed it, but the thought of going further repulsed and frightened me. I was afraid of ruining potential relationships, so I never really talked to anyone about it, though it ruined them anyway when my disinterest would come off as something being wrong with my partner.

(Around this time I was also struggling with being into this meme kink that made me feel like a freak, so I was busy forgetting about that whole mishap in my formation. I also didn’t believe the infatuation with the concept was sexual, but just ideological. Also my religious upbringing made me feel pretty sure those “weird” thoughts were sinful.)

Fast forward to college—met my favorite guy with lots of brain food for us to feast on in conversation. At some point he confesses, “yeah, I have a weird fetish, and I actually can’t enjoy sex without it. I was super embarrassed of it for a long time, and thought it was objectively bad, but when I tried to accept it I finally could pleasure myself.”

To myself: Huh. I have a weird kink, too, but I’m asexual. Wait, can I have a kink and be ace? Wait...

Turns out I had to fantasize about my weird fetish I’d buried to get off, which I guiltily had been burying for years and never intended to talk to anyone about. Thankfully my guy is pretty into my kink, and I can enjoy most of his, so for the first time we’re being sexually fulfilled. But like, that was YEARS of undue stress and anxiety. Even though there’s nothing wrong at all with being ace, I wasn’t actually, and not knowing what was wrong with my sexuality made me feel like I’d be alone and confused forever. If I hadn’t been desperately trying to forget about my niche kink, I probably would’ve recognized the feelings were sexual and ended up having my first orgasm BEFORE the age of twenty.

TL;DR My sex life is dependent on a super specific kink but I thought I was just asexual.

Why_Am_I_On_Reddit_,c8rbcl,"Throwaway as I'm still trying to forget this ever happened and would die inside if anyone ever found out. Happened a few months ago. Let's just say I'm in my 20s and haven't been in a relationship, gotten past a third date, or had sex. 

I found this girl, who for the first time in all my life I can say I fell for, she was smart, beautiful, could make me smile, and so on. I had fallen head over heels for her, and was the first person I've ever felt this way about before.

We had been out on 4 or 5 dates before and constantly talking daily, throughout work, university and what ever plans we had. This all changed after the last time I saw her, as this was the afternoon I regret most in my life so far. She didn't know by this point I was a virgin.

Here's me, with a beautiful girl in my bedroom talking, and chilling, when we get down to it. She starts kissing me, and pulls me onto the bed on top of her. By this point my mind is racing, happy that finally, today I will lose my virginity. Here's me, my mind racing, thinking to myself on how I cannot mess this up. That day, or that whole month to be honest, wasn't great, I had an exam previous to seeing her, and my final exam a few days after so was pretty stressed out.

After about 30 mins of kissing and rolling about, we get down to it, i whip out the condom and put it on and she pulls me onto of her once again, here's me looking down at her, turned on as hell, admiring her. The next thing I know, I end up bottling it. I learned that the vagina is much lower than what I thought, and tried to insert, but I don't know why, for what ever reason, be it stress and nerves I didn't have it in my and just couldn't put it in her.

I kind of roll over in frustration, and embarrassed and watch the disappointed in her. It was here I confessed I've not done this before and we lay there. Next thing she  gets on top of me and we start at it again. At this point she tries to put it in herself and start again, but at this point I see her eyes start to water, and feel bad. After her trying her best to get laid she rolls over and we lay In silence, with the occasional word or two for 5 mins or so.

Next thing I remember, she gets up and starts to dress herself and then says to call her if I want to see her again once she's back down my way next week. From that day on she distanced herself, and went cold. Told me I made her feel gross and bad about herself, but told me two weeks after, which I tried to explain I didn't mean for that and that's not what I at all thought.

A week later I confront her about the problem and she explains she feels it would be weird to see me again and go back there with the awkwardness but still really likes me. It has to be one of the most embarrassing stories I have, which I'll never tell a loving soul outside of this post  and still think back to that day and regret it.

Satahdi,c8xma4,"So, about 2 years ago, my long-term girlfriend (of 4 years) broke up with me and started dating another guy in the same circle of friends within a fortnight. 

When we sat down for an honest talk, she told me I was skinny fat and not attractive anymore for her. She loved me for my personality but that only lasted for so long.

So, after spending a couple of months holed up in my apartment, drinking and smoking my life away, I decided to take it as positively as I could and signed up at a gym (this was a little over a year ago). I've been eating well and working out; cut down on the alcohol and cigarettes. So, naturally, I was feeling upbeat enough to start dating again. Easy-peezy right? 

NOPE! the kind of girls I find attractive (not into fooling around) stay away from mein the romantic sense. The girls that are, are the ones who aren't looking for anything serious and it's just about fooling around.

timetoplaythrowaway,c84x2l," So this TIFU didn't happen today, but rather, a few months ago. It was 9th grade English class and I had a big essay to read. You had to choose a character from To Kill a Mockingbird and an action to defend. I  chose Mayella Ewell accusing Tom Robinson of rape because I love challenging myself.

As an important note: I do not condone her accusation, I simply chose a topic to defend. Was it right? No. Did I give good reasoning for her choice while saying that she did a very wrong thing? Yes.

I had 3 great points. One of them was that she was living in a world where racism was commonplace and that she had been raised by a very racist father. This would mean that racism was not only accepted, but expected of her because of the societal pressures. 

All was going great. I was reading my long ass essay and making great points that were catching attention. I was wrapping up my stellar essay, reading it in front of the class. It was one of the last sentences. On the paper was written ""rape was not only accepted, but expected of her"". I had written the essay mostly all at once. I had been tired. I had written the words rape and racism over and over. It was so easy to have mixed these words up. I saw no issue with the sentence and read it proudly aloud to my classmates and sweet older female teacher. 

I was on the next sentence when my teacher said ""Did you just say what I think you did?"" At first, I was confused. Then as I looked at the people laughing, I realized that I had zoned out and blindly read the paper. I looked down to see the words ""rape was accepted and expected of her"". Naturally, I was horrified, but it was kind of morbidly funny to me. I started laughing. I tried to compose myself. I started through the next sentence again after re-reading the previous one correctly, but in the middle of my new sentence I burst out laughing. I couldn't stop. The words ""rape was accepted and expected of her"" played over and over in my head. I'm normally one to be professional about these things, but I was so stressed at that time that I couldn't gather myself. I loudly asked for a merciful god to kill me before handing in my essay and proceeding to laugh as my male friends teased me.

MyNSFWside,c8rz33,"A couple weeks ago, I was grocery shopping, and I was in too big a hurry to wait in the deli counter line. There was a case of pre-sliced meats, and I saw a package that said something like ""Turkey ends"". It contained the final chunks of a block of turkey that remained when all convenient parts had been sliced off.

I was in a hurry, and it was cheap (about a third of the usual price of sliced turkey), so I grabbed the package. The next day, I ate some of that turkey on a sandwich, and it was delicious! The ""chunkiness"" of it made me feel like I was eating Thanksgiving turkey instead of over-processed deli meats.

Best of all, since I have a sensitive stomach, it was nice and bland -- didn't even seem to have that mildly chemically ""deli turkey"" taste.

A couple days ago, I was back at that store, and I looked in the same case -- and found another package of turkey ends. Bingo! Into the cart it went.

Today, I made myself a sandwich, noticing that the turkey looked kind of odd. It had an orange tinge to it. Well, I figured, beggars can't be choosers, and I was sure it would taste just fine.

Chomped into the first bite and *hmmmmm…* it didn't taste like the other ""turkey ends"" I had bought. Oh well, it wasn't bad.

Around the third bite, I realized what that orange tint meant -- this was *spicy* turkey. I don't know what kind of spice it was, but my mouth was getting a burning sensation, and my delicate stomach was starting to complain.

I pitched the rest of the sandwich into the trash and filled a cereal bowl with plain yogurt, which I then gobbled down. It temporarily extinguished the mouth fire, but it didn't coat my tummy as fast as I had hoped. So right now, I have unpleasant simmering sensations in my mouth and belly, and I might have to polish off the rest of that tub of yogurt.

Next time I spy a package of turkey ends, I'm gonna scrutinize its color **very** carefully.

TL;DR -- I enjoyed some cheap delicious turkey, tried to buy the same kind again, but ended up accidentally pouring weirdly spiced turkey into my sensitive stomach.",tifu,TIFU by eating the wrong kind of turkey
HeCallsMeGirlfriend,ca0ccp,"Obligatory: This didn't happen today. I'll call my sister Nina for the sake of this post.

&amp;#x200B;

So, two little bits of backstory: 

A while back, a therapist suggested I write things that made my life feel meaningful, and donating blood was one of those things. It was a rather short list, I'm sad to say, but it's a way I can help others despite having difficulty with motivation. I have been meaning to donate blood for a while now, and since school is now out, I figured I would be able to do that. Moving on.

A few months ago, I realized I didn't smell quite as well as most people. It wasn't that I had *no* sense of smell, but I just couldn't really smell anything unless it was a rather strong smell. Some past experiences started making sense. I didn't usually notice cat litter being smelly, while my dad seemed to complain about it frequently. I preferred picking up the dog shit on walks to holding the leash, because I only ever smelled it... maybe half the time? Even less? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, about two months after I first noticed it, I told Nina about it. She suggested I see a doctor. Personally, I didn't care - and still don't - about getting a full sense of smell. I really only seem to hear people complain about scents, and my current job has a lot of 'janitor' duties (garbage, toilets, and cleaning in general). Still... I'd also done a Biology project way back when on some random disease, which had a lack of smelling as a symptom. I figured I would humour her, in case it was some underlying sign of another issue I had. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the doctor (first fuck up), who seemed to misinterpret that this was something *new* happening to me... no matter how frequently I told her that it wasn't new. She sent me off for X-Rays and a blood test, and prescribed something that could potentially clear things up if there was any blockage. This is my second fuck-up. The medication wasn't covered, so I was out 40 bucks for something I didn't really care about anyway. All I needed were the test results, and the tests are free where I live. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first two places I went to were a bust (the first had closed in April, and the other didn't even *do* X-Rays), but a few weeks later I managed to get seen. As a bonus, I could do both tests in the same building. I had some time that day, so I decided to also go to the blood donation building to see if I could get something else done. Once again, the nurse there seemed to think this was something new from the last two months, simply because it's when I noticed it. Since it was an 'unknown,' I couldn't donate until the results were in. I took my free snacks and went home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this morning I decided to check the results, in case they were up. I expected them to take another week, maybe week and a half, but they were already there - and a fun little warning sign told me that something was outside its typical range. I looked through it, and it was TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). It was at 0.29 mlU/L with a normal range of 0.32-4.00. I quickly called my dad, and it turned out to be the reason I tend to get emotional when I don't eat on time; he and another sister of mine have the same problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, now that I have a test saying something *is* wrong with my blood, I'm scared to go back to the doctor's. I don't want her to diagnose me with some thyroid issue when I went there for my *nose*. I don't want to get put on some medication when I already know I just need to watch my diet. Even worse, I don't know the implications this will have on my eligibility to donate blood. I don't know many people who would really get why it's so important for me to donate blood, but it's... I see it as one of the big things that's kept me alive through times when I was more suicide. If I was dead, I couldn't help them by giving blood. It's morbid, but it got me through, and I'm so scared to lose it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I went to the doctor for something I didn't care about and now I'm scared to follow-up in case I can't donate blood anymore.",tifu,TIFU by taking my sister's advice to see a doctor when I didn't have to
United_Tomatillo,c9vi4p,"ok so, English isn't my first language so there will be a lot of typos, but it's also a bit needed for the story of this and this didn't exactly happen today but about a month ago...

There are a lot of words I don't understand the meaning of or just use them in the wrong time.

I have a teacher who comes from the UK, and I had a good friendly relationship with him (since where I come from it's common to call your teacher by their first name and that opens up a chance to befriend your teacher in a way).

So, I was working on adding characters for my comic, and I thought it would be fun to ask my teacher if he wanted to be a character in it. Since he's funny, close with the kids and so on...

So I asked the minor info that I would need and that's where it went wrong...

So I wrote to him ""I'm gonna add you to the server, it's where I have all da jizz"" (that's the mistake, that last word...)

(I am also a person who has a hard time being told off...though I do understand why)

He replied with ""erm, I don't want you to talk about such things with me, its weird"" (and I thought he was talking about me asking about a bit of information)

Me: ""I am weird, I thought you already knew""

Teacher: ""Yeah, But it's *inappropriate*"" and my dumbass still thought it was about the information, but I was in a very sensitive mood that day for some reason...so all I wrote was ""alright"" and then went to cry in the bathroom, that's how sensitive I was xD.

after a while of minor sobs I googled up what the word ""jizz"" meant...and I got to find out what it was and not what I expected it was...

I quickly went onto Discord (this is where I have been chatting so I'm sorry I didn't point that out earlier!) and quickly typed out an apology to him:

Me: ""I apologize, I thought ""jizz"" was a gentler word for *shit* (yes, no joke, and I don't even remember where I got that), I had to google up the meaning now and I am so sorry for saying that"" and he wrote that it was okay and that he said it was good of me to google it up...Man I still feel bad about it till today...

RandytheRubiksCube,c9l0ba,"Obligatory not today, but yesterday.





So basically, my family moved into our house like 8 years ago, and have Xfinity internet. Recently (months ago) the connection started going downhill. Blackouts, no signal, random drops in speed, the works.




When it first started happening, I asked my dad to fix it and he was like, ""you do some research and you fix it."" And repeat. Well yesterday during a blackout I found the folder that contained the info about the Xfinity account.




When the wifi came back, I tried the password but it didn't work. Guessing the answer to the security question , I hackerman'd my way to resetting the password and username. This prompted me to learn about our plan and what our speed was. I did a test and learned our speed when the network was unused was 35 MBPS. Absolutely terrible for a ~$100 a month plan. I then looked at our modem/router thing, and learned that our speed should be 250 MBPS. 




I contacted customer service and made a complaint. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, he scheduled a technician to look at the house to fix the issue. Hallelujah.




Now today, the tech came and, while investigating outside, found that our wire that connects our house to the internet was chewed through and flooded somehow. The copper connection was rusted worse than any he had seen. He told us that our wifi was the worst connection he had ever seen. He replaced the wire and our connection is now at 250 MBPS. Finally. While the wire breaking wasn't my fault, months of shitty internet could have been avoided if I had been proactive about the situation, instead of forgetting about it after the wifi came back on.


TL;DR: Our wifi was bad, finally tried to fix it, learned that the wire had been chewed up, flooded, and the connection was rusted. It was fixed, but these issues went on for months. That could have been avoided if I had just spent 15 minutes learning about the plan we had and being proactive.",tifu,TIFU by not contacting customer support
DDT28,c9cw45,"TL;DR at bottom

Ok so over the past school year I had multiple classes with this girl I liked, but for the majority of the year she was with this other dude. They broke up and so I made my move and she seemed interested. Long story short, she was never really clear with how she felt (she said she liked me, but wasn’t ready for a relationship while flirting with other guys). So I decide to end my pursuit and until school ended we were still good friends. As summer begins we talk less and less, to the point where we’ve had no contact with each other. So I’m kind of missing her, not even because I liked her but because we were really good friends and I missed having a friend like that. So I tell my guy friend later on about how I felt and he’s a g so when they were about to hang with some other people he mentioned my name and so I get invited. In the end the driver has to go home or else he’d miss curfew and get grounded so me and my crush get dropped off at my house where I’d need to take my car to drive her home. So the drive to her house was decent, we talked and overall had a good time considering it was like 8 minutes long. On the way back, however, I start thinking if i should maybe reignite my interest in her and how I missed our connection. At this point I’ve completely dozed off and before I realized I drive my car into the ditch. The car isn’t damaged too bad and tbh you can barely tell anything happened, but omg when it happened I was scared shitless.

Tholaran97,c9bgmt,"This actually happened today (or technically yesterday, by the time I finish typing it). Today is the fourth of July, and as a tradition on this day many of us Americans set off fireworks to celebrate. We didn't really have money to buy a bunch of fireworks this year, and many of the places that typically set them off weren't going to today, so we decided to just sit at home instead, which bummed me out a bit. Some people down the street decided to let off some that can be seen from our home. We were watching them for a while, when I remembered we have some leftover fireworks from last year. I search through the house and found a small bottle rocket. I set it up, light it, and step away. The thruster ignites and the firework drops straight to the ground right in front of me. I turned away, shielding my face from the impending firecracker sized pop. Luckily, the firework was a dud, and it just fizzles out in the grass. I searched through the house again, hoping to find something a little bigger and less anticlimactic. I found an old mortar tube and 8 fireworks to go in it. This was much better. I go to the end of our driveway to set them off when I was told we should do it in the road instead. The road is sloped slightly, meaning all the fireworks are going to be launched at an angle. I didn't want to set them off there because I was concerned one of them could fly off onto our next-door neighbor's property, but the family was concerned about setting them off so close to our house, so they decided to move to the road.

We set off the first three without incident. They were nice, although kind of small. I go to get the next one. It was a rocket firework like the first one, but this one was bigger. The stick had broken off completely so we didn't fire it last year. Not wanting to waste a perfectly good firework, I decide to load it into the mortar and launch it that way. I light it, drop it in the tube, and run. After a few seconds of silence, the rocket shoots out of the tube, and almost immediately turns and flies straight at our neighbor's house. It flies to within 20 feet of the house and explodes with the noise of a gunshot, showering their home and cars with colorful burning embers. My family begins running back to the house, knowing how badly we just fucked up. I run to the road to pick up the mortar and the rest of the fireworks, when I hear our neighbor come out of his house and start yelling at us, understandably pissed. We all apologize and my family decides to call it a night before he calls the police. I put the fireworks down and continue watching our neighbor's for a bit. After a few minutes, I decide set off the 4 we had left, at the end of the road this time.

It may surprise you to know that we don't have a very good history with fireworks. There isn't a single year that we set them off that doesn't have at least one go where it's not supposed to, or explode at the wrong time (had one go off in the tube once. My ears are still ringing from that one), but this one was bigger than our previous fuck ups, in both scale and firework size. Needless to say, I'm pretty sure our neighbor hates us now, which sucks, but hopefully we can move past it. One thing is for sure though, we are not buying those fucking rocket fireworks anymore.

TLDR: I decided to set off year old fireworks for the 4th of July. One was a dud, and one flew straight at and exploded in front of our neighbor's house, showering it in burning embers, and potentially ruined any trust we may have built up with him over the years.",tifu,TIFU by setting off year old fireworks.
theDragonHunter2k,c8tdte,"Now, before i start on the story, I will say that I’m not naturally a tempered person, so rage isn’t a thing that happens to me often. Anyway, onto what happened.

I was in my bedroom playing a game on my phone. The game was Geometry Dash (look it up if you aren’t familiar with it, but basically its a rhythm game crossed with platforming for lack of a better description), and I was playing a really hard (and annoying) level in it. Now, near the end of the level there is a particularly hard part that I had already died to around 6 times, but after that I generally have no issues with when I’m practicing that part. However, when I finally get past the hard part, I think I’m about to finally beat the level.

But no.

I manage to die due to an error in the level (the death was not fully my fault). This annoyed me so much. I was so stressed at this point I looked for something to bite down on to release stress without screaming. In my stressed state my mind leaps to the quickest accessible object, the phone in my hand. I insert the corner into my mouth and bite down. The stress begins relieving but then...

Crack.

I immediately knew what happened. I took the phone out of my mouth and look at the screen. 3 core punctures on the bottom where teeth went in and long cracks going up the entire phone (i have an iPhone 6 for those interested). 

Its not going to cost too much to repair (around £45, which was a lot less than I was expecting) but I’m annoyingly not going to be able to get it fixed for another 2 weeks or so.

willi1027,c8fa98,"Ahhh, so where do I start. I suppose background information is necessary, so here it is. Now I come from a pretty religious Muslim family. Now islamically (pretty sure in other religions too), u cannot attend to ur sexual desires alone per se. Nay, u need ur spouse to u know, fulfill ur desires. So u cannot flick the bean or jerk it off before taking a hot bath and calling it a night. I however, am not that religious, hence I jerk it off before a cold shower (120 degrees summer) and call it a night. 

It so happened that on this fine night, my brother for whatever reason, was in my bathroom and because I was so sweaty I still needed to take a shower. Yes, I decided that I would use my parents’ bathroom. As I went upstairs, I saw the car headset on the table of my living room upstairs and it hit me, VR porn! I had never tried it before but had heard a lot about it and so I thought, why not give it a go? I had explored every other legal genre, and so I only had one left, VR. I gathered my clothes, hid the VR headset in my towel and off to the bathroom I was.  

I will not get into the details of what I saw, but oh was it interesting. I loved it and consequently, I gushed out my fluids of passion. However, due to my inability to see where I was gushing out, I could not fully wipe all the fluids. The bathroom is quite a huge one, with white marble tiles all around, and so the color of the floor does not help either. I just wiped within a few inches around me and off to the shower I was. It was a heavenly shower, especially after my very intense excitement, and I wore my clothes, and without giving it a thought, off to the cinema I was. 

I come back home, and as I am scrolling through my reddit feed on mobile, I hear the dreadful call, “willi1027, can u come upstairs please”. I have many younger siblings, and so my mother did not want to discuss this in front of them. At the time however, it still hasn’t hit me why I was being called. I rushed upstairs as I thought that she was calling me to do some usual chore like bring her a cup of water or something of the sort. Nope. It was indeed, because I had ejaculated all over he clean, shiny bathroom floor. Now because there was residue left on the floor, the smell over-powered all the shampoo and conditioner I had used, and the smell of my ejaculation was left in that bathroom, which by the way resembles the smell of bleach. Yep, as u might have guessed, I pulled the “spilt bleach” excuse. Did not go well. Turns out, I also had put the tissues u wiped with put into the trash can and it also smelt like bleach. It was like being a murderer with a video footage against me and still trying to deny the facts. Could not happen.

I had to admit my mistake, after which I got an hour lecture of how I should abstain from all sexual desires until I am married. Suffice it to say I cannot face her now and I am now hiding out of shame. Eye contact has not been initiated since then and it has been about 5 hours. I just hope my father does find out coz it would be even more embarrassing, considering he believes that I am truly mature now. Damn it, never jerking off in parents’ bathroom ever again. Lesson learnt. Don’t do what I did, for indeed, the parents’ bathroom is not a place to jerk off.

ZeroCreature74,c830k1,"I’m starting this off by telling you I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, a cat, and two dogs. My dogs are decently sized at about 60lbs a piece: one GSD mix (Aurora) and the other is a Beagle/Heeler mix (Guinevere). This story revolves around the gluttonous asshole, Guinevere.

Anyways, a few minutes after starting my shower I hear a *thump* of my bathroom trash can lid closing. I move the curtain back and see Guinevere **chewing**... then I see it. She was chewing on a USED TAMPON that I had wrapped in toilet paper after I used it! I started screaming how disgusting she was and before I could grab her, she ran off. I knew that by the time I rushed to get out and dry off, she would have swallowed it, so I took some extra time.

Once done, I ran out of the bathroom and immediately told my boyfriend what happened - I’m sure the disgust on both of our faces was evident. He asked what we should do and since it had only been a minute or two I decided to call the vet and see what the dosage of hydrogen peroxide would be in order to get her to throw up (or see if there was an alternative solution).

I ended up talking to a vet tech after office hours while she was at her sons baseball game... talk about embarrassing. She laughed at my story and told me it’s not a big deal and it happens more often than people think. She also said that since it had only been a few minutes, it was used, I had a large dog, and she didn’t eat anything sharp, she should be able to vomit it back up without any issues... but if she didn’t vomit that I would need to bring her in for surgery to remove it. *Great*.

I get off the phone and my boyfriend and I put some puppy pads in her kennel, shove the hydrogen peroxide dose down her throat, and locked her in the kennel to do the deed.

While my boyfriend is gagging in the bedroom saying he can’t do it I’m taking deep breaths knowing my expected duty. I’m watching her stand up, lay down, stand up, pace in circles. It wasn’t long before in one single upchuck she vomited everything back up. It was so disgusting I was dry heaving the entire time I cleaned it.

I’ve never dreaded cleaning up vomit so much in my entire life, but we finally did it. I can’t even talk out loud about what she did because it makes me gag, ferociously.

TL;DR: Guinevere found a trash can full of my used tampons and decided it was the perfect pre-dinner snack. Forcing the dog to throw up said snack was not a pretty sight that almost made every human in the apartment vomit.

JohnnyCenter,c8zti8,"So a little backstory for this tale. I worked as a ""support person"", don't know the English word for it, for about half a year. It was a side job where I could make a little extra money. Basically I get assigned one person that has a disability which can make it difficult for that person to go outside and socialize. So my goal is to make that person more comfortable with other people by spending some time together each week. I was assigned a 16 year old boy. However, recently he decided that he didn't need me anymore and I agreed. His parents though wanted to give me the proper send-off by having me over for dinner.

That day was yesterday and I wanted to look spiffy and clean for my resignation party. I had bought a box of chocolates as a gift as well to make sure I left them with the best impression of me. I slipped into my favorite pair of jeans. I knew it had a hole underneath my crotch, but I wasn't gonna let a tiny hole that most people don't even notice ruin a pair of jeans that makes my ass look this great. Never underestimate the power of a man's ass. What I didn't know was that my underwear also had a hole in the exact same area.

Some of you have probably put two and two together and can see where this story is going. I arrived at their house, was pleasantly greeted and sat down on their couch next to the boy. The mom was in front of me preparing dinner while we waited for the father to come home after work. We chatted for a while and it seemed like everyone was having a good time. The dinner was ready and the mother asked her son to set the table. I looked down at the couch table to reach for my phone when I noticed a colored spot on their grey couch. After poking it I realized that it indeed was my nutsack. 

I had just planted my balls on their couch. Obviously I was more concerned if anyone noticed. They hadn't given off any hints of that being the case so I might be in the clear. Regardless I had to make sure that my package stayed wrapped. I crossed my legs as hard as I could to an almost painful degree and sat like that for several hours. 

Near the end of the party I began to feel comfortable. Not with my nuts as they were probably looking like Thanos's chin by now, but comfortable with them probably not noticing. It was time to say goodbye and head home. I stood near the door putting on my shoes while the boy and his parents was standing by the entrance wishing me good luck. I bent down to tie my laces and just like the beat, it dropped. The entire sack visible. I quickly stood back up hoping none of them noticed my tea bag. I tried to tie my laces on one leg, but that stretched the pants as well and yet again it was revealed. I kinda tripped from doing this and the mother uttered a quick ""Oh! Whoopsie"" as I got back up. 

Screw it I thought and walked quickly out without tying my laces. On my drive home all I could think about is if they saw me or not. I knew that this question would haunt me for the rest of my mere mortal life.

Until I got home and remembered that she said ""Whoopsie"" before I tripped. So here's hoping she's a psychic...

My wife and I mess around with each other a lot. Slap butts, pull pranks, etc. Well, one thing I like to do is put cold stuff on her skin for shock value. So I grabbed a beer, sat down next to my wife, and saw a perfect opportunity. Her legs extended out together on the couch, I figured I would put my beer can in the ""crack"" of her thighs.

So we decided to try the blindfold game where we have fun while I’m blindfolded (we just improvised and used a necktie because I don’t actually have a real blindfold). 

Just before he penetrated me, I asked him to make sure he was really lubricated. So he opened my nightstand drawer where I usually keep my lubricants. In the heat of things we forgot he had used up all the lubricants last time (Monday) and I was planning on buying some this weekend.

It was late, July 4th, and we weren’t going to leave my apartment in our state of nakedness and in his state of erection. So I just told him to grab some lotion from my bathroom counter. In my mind I thought he was going to grab the big bottle of Neutrogena with the pump. Then during the heat of penetration he covered my mouth with his hand and I smelled La Mer. I immediately freaked out. We stopped, I took off my blind, and confirmed he grabbed the jar of La Mer. The jar looked inexpensive like a drugstore type body cream that cost a few dollars, that’s why he just grabbed it. But it actually costs $300 for that small 10 oz jar. 

Well I let him finish because what could we really do by then? And I was certainly not going to let him leave with blue balls. But he scooped up almost 3/4 of the jar and it was the most expensive “fun” I’ve ever had.

theundeadthrowaway,c2f0cl,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a few months ago. 

I was in a really good relationship with my ex and I still miss the way that it was. However me being a stupid horny idiot decided that my feelings for a work colleague was more important. 

I cheated, she found out. Then the bad shit happened.

I came home after she messaged me telling me she knew about it to a trashed house. Everything was a mess, there were burnt books in my living room of which I have no clue how the fire didn't spread to the rest of my house. The smoke alarm was ripped out and left on the floor so I guess nobody could hear it go off. 

She spread makeup over all of the walls, lipstick spelled cheater on the bedroom door. Bedsheets everywhere, chairs broken, microwave broken with a shit ton of metal in it. 

The upstairs was wet, she poured water everywhere making everything stink. I'm thinking that the power was out because of this also.

Everything was fucking trashed and deliberately ruined.

So...

You're probably wondering how I superglued my urethra shut.

After everything was sorted with cleaning the house up from the kind help of electricians, plumbers and my cleaning lady. The house seemed to be relatively undamaged. There was something missing though, and that was my girlfriend.

I got very sad, lonely and depressed and didn't know what to do with myself. I mean I did this fuck up it's my fault right?

I decided to do what most guys do when they have no clue what to do. I sat on my sofa, opened up pornhub on my phone, and got to work. That's when it hit me. ""I wonder if we still have lube upstairs?"". I looked in the bedroom and in the drawers I found it. It was great! I got back to work with my dick and everything seemed okay for the first 30 seconds.

It started to get all sticky, but not like bodily fluid sticky, that horrible dry DIY sticky that you get from superglue. My ex probably poured some in there as an act of revenge.

I stopped masturbating and I felt this awful burning feeling in the tip of my urethra. It fucking hurt so fucking much and it wouldn't stop. Of which I has no clue what to do so I went to the bathroom and started to try to wash it with warm water (of which is shit as my house has two settings when it comes to water, arctic ice cold or boiling fucking hot hotter than the sun hot). In the process and panic I grabbed onto the handle to release the water and my hand got stuck to it. I had to rip my hand off of this thing leaving bits of skin on the tap.

My dick was sealed shut. Thank fuck for the NHS. Amongst the burning I called NHS 111 to see what I should do. They ended up telling me that I should go to A&amp;E as soon as possible as this could develop very quickly into an emergency. I got into my car with my burning dick and drove to the hospital. 

Luckily they recognised that this wasn't an issue to wait 4+ hours to get seen. I was taken in straight away. 

The glue had completely sealed my urethra shut and there was no way of getting it back open without surgery. Long story short. I went under, they cut the bits away and now my urethra is slightly bigger.

throwaway488637,c48agf,"Well, not today, this happened back in November of 2018, but I didn't know of this sub back then. Also on a throwaway because I know this is going to attract some very nasty comments.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for context, the state I live in is very liberal. The few conservative students in my school are either smart enough to keep their mouth shut or are extremely bold in their views and shove it in everyone's face. I tend to have pretty liberal political views, except for one matter - abortion. I'm also a dude.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a substitute teacher in our biology class so things get a little rowdy among the class. I hear one girl across the room mention very loudly that she does not believe men should have opinions on abortion because they can't give birth. Wut. I think it's safe to assume even most pro-choice people would find this statement a little out-there. So, being an idiot and not thinking, I pipe up with an ""Are you serious?"" to this girl. This leads to someone at that girl's table asking me what MY views on abortion were. Being the stupid idiot person that I am, I sheepishly admit that I am pro-life. This led to half of my bio class ganging up on me screaming about how awful and terrible of a person I was for being pro-life (there were a couple other pro-life students in the class, but they didn't say anything because they weren't stupid.) I said some things I now regret and felt really terrible about the whole situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I vented to some friends about this and tried to put the whole thing behind me (almost all of my friends are pro-choice but they respect my views). Also turns out that the discussion I prompted in my class led to another argument in another bio class that day where two conservative students were in the same situation as me (I believe that argument literally started from someone saying ""deletus that fetus""). I felt like a piece of shit but I tried to put my fuck up behind me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a few days later, I have a presentation I have to do in front of my entire English class. It involves asking the class 3 questions and hearing and responding to their answers. As the first question comes up, it takes a good thirty seconds for anyone to raise their hand. I had to ask twice before one of my friends decided to give in and answer. The next question takes even longer. I just skipped over the third one because nobody was answering. It felt very weird to me but I assumed people were just not energetic that day.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, later that day, the same girl that had originally stated that men shouldn't have opinions on abortion sends me a very long, heartfelt text. She started off by saying that she respects my views and she instantly regretting making that first comment as soon as I called her out on it, as it wasn't quite what she meant. She then describes how people have been talking about me behind my back, saying that I hate all women and even making uncalled for comments about my religion. Basically spreading awful rumors saying I was a terrible person who hated all women. She also said that a few of the girls from my bio class started a petition to make people not answer any of the questions to my English presentation, in hopes that I would get a worse grade on it. How fucking petty do you have to be to make a literal petition to hope someone gets a worse grade on their English project??? (Jokes on them tho, I got an A+ on it!)

&amp;#x200B;

This whole situation led to actual strangers hating me even though I haven't even met them before. A friend of mine was talking to a girl that I've never even spoke to, and she claimed that I despised her. There was pretty much no way to get my reputation back other than hope people would forget about it after a while.

Mysticzizu,c0k7l5,"I’ve been straight for awhile now, and I never really questioned my sexuality much. This just kinda happened by chance. My friends (all male) and I decided to take a vacation together to a very nice resort with a stop along the way and we rented a tour bus because we wanted to spend a lot of time together. We stayed in the back of the bus and did various things- from singing one direction to playing games together on our phones. Eventually we made it to our first stop, which is where all of this ended up happening. It was a place for white water rafting, because we figured it would be a new experience and enjoy expanding our horizons. A few of us per boat, and an instructor to help us make sure we made it down the river safely. Here and there we would have currents pushing us around, but nothing became too serious until we came across a rather larger drop in comparison to the others (maybe around 3 feet. Probably not actually too much.) Our instructor said we’d surf the drop, and proceeded to guide us towards it. Wanting to feel the adrenaline, I was quite excited. Once we were on the wave, I stopped feeling the excitement as the raft immediately flipped and I got pulled by the current. I’m not sure how fast it might’ve been going, but I could feel my feet and legs scraping against the rocks. I was bleeding but wasn’t in too much trouble until suddenly, ass first, I hit s massive flat rock underwater. It flipped me as I hit it and I didn’t regain control of my momentum until I reached an area where the current calmed down. Though the rock didn’t penetrate, it was definitely painful to have taken the rock in the ass.

MacklinOfficial,c72skp,"This happened a while ago but I am still feeling the consequences now.

This particular FU is spread across many years and it may seem like background info, but is actually portraying a pattern of my failures as a mentor. It’s quite a story, however, I have to admit. 

(TL;DR at bottom)


Me and my father (my mom had put me up for adoption when I was young, he wasn’t my biological father, but he was the best dad ever) and a couple friends were vacationing out of our home country. We had rented a car and were in a remote desert town and it broke down. We needed a part and we went to the local market, hoping to find a replacement. The owner was very stingy and refused our payment but his employee was helpful and nice. He was very young (probably about nine, the child labor laws were very different from what I was used to), but he did his best. Eventually he had convinced his manager to listen to us. After a very long and trying period of haggling and deal making, we got our part, but my father was torn at the fact of leaving this young man behind to work hard hours and be paid very little. We were extremely religious and this impacted our decision.

We consulted his mother. His dad had never been around, and she told us he was extremely gifted, and that he could grow up to have great success if he could get out of the country. We had suspected this but she confirmed it. She wanted him out of there so she said her goodbyes and I gained a new brother. 

A couple weeks after, my father was involved in a freak accident and tragically and suddenly passed away. He told me in his last moments to raise my brother and that he had total faith in me. I was scared that I would let him down, but I eventually put this behind me. 

Years passed, he had grown into one of the most blessed and powerful men in our religion. (gonna keep which one a secret for privacy reasons) and he knew it. He was still a good guy at heart, but I could tell he was getting a little too prideful. We were closer than ever at this time. We were with each other at all times, we never fought and I loved him very much. 

There was a time where for some reason it seemed like everyone was against us, we had messy dealings, we had people try and kill us because of our religion, and we lots of friendships were made and lost. One of which being a very influential political figure who we trusted very much. As I later found out, my brother and her hooked up quite often and eventually got married without my knowledge. There are rules in our religion that forbid this, but he ignored them.

I was blind to the path he was walking on. He eventually started becoming friendly with a man who slowly and quietly tried to make him join his cult. This cult was evil and only sought to kill people of our religion. This person told him that he would become very powerful if he embraced their beliefs, more powerful than anyone he had met before. But this would mean he would have to abandon everyone he loved except for his wife. He was told that his wife was dying and that this cult could save her. He fell fast and hard, and after that me and everyone who had helped him become so faithful became his sworn enemies. Eventually him and the leader of this cult decided they wanted to finish us once and for all. They burned down all our meeting places and all but 3 known people survived. Me, the leader of our faith, and his right hand man.

He ran. He took his wife (who was pregnant with twins, and who had told me his whereabouts) and started rambling about grandiose plans to become important and powerful. I walked in on him physically assaulting her. I tried to reason with him but he was too far gone. It came to blows, and because both of us had extensive fighting training, the fight was long and hard. He was wounded very bad but he survived. I have decided to live my life watching after his kids (who thankfully survived) and hope that I do better leading them in our faith. I failed my brother and now he is brutally injured and is sworn to kill me and his children. I didn’t prepare him enough and now my consequences have arrived. 

If you are reading this brother I have something to say. I have failed you, Anakin; I have failed you. You allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, and you became the very thing you swore to destroy. You were the Chosen One. It was said you would destroy the Sith, not join them. Bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness. You were my brother Anakin, I loved you.

When it comes to offers and anything that seems too good to be true, I am usually really good at not falling for it... until today.

I was eating and browsing reddit on my phone, when I got a notification saying Elon musk is having a giveaway on Twitter.

The tweet was a reply to a tweet Elon had just tweeted and the tweet had a link to where Elon is giving away ethereum and the deal is you send .5 ethereum and get 5 back (example)

So my dumb ass send Elon 1.15 etherum ($310.32) and I wait to get my 10  ethereum back

skylinker,c7i1z8,"I was scheduled to fly back to my home country from Dubai which is about a long-ass 10 hour flight. Now I'm the type of person that has to have an isle seat otherwise I get nauseous.

I was happy to discover that my pre-booked seat in the isle was indeed allocated to me, but to my disappointment I got seated next to a huge overweight man. There wasn't even a battle for the middle arm-rest, his whole body just sort rolled onto and over the arm-rest, with his arms sitting on his stomach sort off. To give you an idea I am a petite 5ft1 female, so I felt like I wasn't getting my money's worth for a full seat...

Luckily about 10mins after we took off the guy at the window seat asked the air hostess if he could move to a different seat as the flight wasn't fully booked. So he moved from his seat, meaning that there was an open seat available next to the over-weight man that was sitting between me and the guy who just left. However, to add to my disappointment he did not move!! He just stayed in his seat, all huddled up against me. I could litterally hear and feel his breathing next to me. 

Ok I have to say about an hour in he eventually moved...but it was a temporary relieve. The overweight guy must have been at the window seat for about 15mins (which was the best 15mins of the flight) before deciding that no he'd rather move back to the seat next to me. Agh! Why?? He did this once or twice...like he couldn't decide where it was more comfortable to sit and eventually just settled by sitting next to me.

Besides me not having space to myself I also found the guy just a bit creepy. I thought ok let me just watch the screen/tv/movie but unfortunately this guy kept watching my screen! Like his screen wasn't even on ever. He kept watching what I was watching from my screen sort of leaning towards it. And to add to that he didn't have any headphones on - so there was no way how he could follow even what was going on. And to top it all I could sense out of the corner of my eye that he kept staring at my face everyone now and then. And then turn his look back to the screen and then after a while back to my face. He also ordered everything that I ordered. This made me feel super uncomfortable.

So this was pretty much the flight for most of the duration. About an hour before we were schedule to land I started feeling light headed and uneasy. You know that feeling like you are going to be sick and time feels like it is slowing down. So I was glad I felt this coming early on, as I got up in time to make my way down to the WC/tiolets in the back of the plane.

Now this is where my memory gets a bit fuzzy. I do remember these WC/tiolet doors were swinging outwards instead of inwards like most other flights I've been on. I was feeling all sweaty and light headed trying to open the damn door! It was like I was scratching at it like a cat scratches a closed door trying to get it...and next moment just blank...

I woke up lieing on the isle floor with all the flight attendants around me. They were looking very concerned and asking me various questions to figure out if I was ok. I felt ok and figured out that I must have fainted and fell over in the isle as I was trying to get into the tiolet door. Sigh.

The air hostesses in their various accents kept asking me all sorts of questions repeatedly. Like what's my name? Where am I from? Where am I heading to? What's my age, what year is it? etc. One even asked me how many fingers is he holding up?? Seriously. I was able to answer all these questions fine and accurately. I could even answer the question when one hostess asked me what my seat number was: It was 10H.

I didn't think much of the questions. But in retrospect now I can understand why I was asked what seat number I was in. See, the hostess was trying to find my ""next of kin"" or possibly a family member that was flying with me. There was no one, I was alone on this flight. And next moment she managed to drag the overweight guy down the isle saying to him that this lady says she knows you! 

Now that was weird. Here I am lieing on the floor, not really with myself properly, I don’t know this guy. This is the last person I want to see. The air hostess claims that I know the guy, but luckily he looked at me and said he doesn't know me and it must be some misunderstanding. That took a while for the hostess to register that we were indeed strangers just sitting next to each other. That felt awful.

Eventually after some sugar water and being waved down with the airline menu cards to cool down I was back at my seat. Next to the guy again. And I would never forget what he said to me next. Bare in mind he didn't speak English well and it wasn't his mother tongue (he was Indian) and spoke broken English. He told me with a huge smile on his face looking all smuck and curious: ""You called for me?"" Awe! the embarrassment trying to convince him that no it was a miscommunication and that the hostess just asked for my seat number and not ""who is the hero that can save me"". In the end I just gave up and let him have his moment. I'm pretty sure he thinks we formed a strong connection on that flight.



TL;DR  On an overnight 10h flight I sat next to an overweight man who didn't give me any space (despite an open seat next to him). He kept staring at me and watching my movie screen without headphones, copying my orders. After feeling ill, I fainted in the passage trying to get into the tiolets. The air hostesses thought me and the guy knew each other and called him to come help me lieing on the floor. He was delighted afterwards and surprised that I called for him to aid me in my distress.

We also traded face pics and he was a good looking dude so I decided to go over to his place.

When I arrive, he says he's at the door so I get out of my car, walk up to see him looking through the glass window in the door, and then he lets me in. That's where the fuck up happens.

sunni318,c1sd9f,"So I cheated on my girlfriend last summer.. it was a fluke thing. We were mutual friends with the girl (let’s call her Sarah) but over the summer, my girlfriend (let’s call her Kleo) had left to go home (from college) and I was staying at college for the summer. So was Sarah for a limited time. One night.. it happened.. I instantly regretted it. I was alone and upset and yes honestly there’s really no explanation. But I never wanted to tell Kleo because I knew it’d destroy her. My way of making it up to Kleo was just to be the best I could be for her. Give her whatever she wants and make her feel like the happiest in the world. For a moment of time it worked .. but little did i know, the secret was killing Sarah. One night the girls were talking and I guess the conversation got deep and Sarah wanted to confess.. without my knowledge she told Kleo everything.. I felt betrayed but liberated because the secret was killing me too.  We hashed it out and me and Kleo ended up getting through it. 

A few months later Kleo is still butt hurt about it and tells me she wants to get back at me and have sex with someone. I knew I effed up so I agreed. But it had to be with someone she did not care for and could cut all ties with.. I found out last week that she did it with her ex. And she KNOWS I COMPLETELY DESPISE HIM because he was horrible to her and put her In a bad space. But that wasn’t it... she tells me she’s also pregnant.. and wants to keep it. I completely flipped out. Btw we’re both 22 and JUST graduated at the end of May. I tell her I want her to abort it because WE had plans of having a baby together and traveling and everything. And because it was a mistake I don’t want to be constantly reminded of what I did to her with an ugly child looking like the stupid disgusting abusive asshole of a father. But no, no matter what I say she insists on having the baby because she’s scared that the abortion will make her not have kids in the future.

I knew she was the one from the beginning ... we’ve been together almost 4 years ... but I can’t be around this because I know in my heart I will never be able to love that child and I feel I will resent her for this decision. This hurts like hell. But I did it to myself... 

Sorry it was long but I needed to get it out. I just got off the phone with her and she told me her final decision that she wanted to keep it ... idk what to do now...

Now I’m left with no choice but to break up with her even though I love her like crazy and wanted to marry her.",tifu,"TIFU by cheating on my girlfriend, she got back at me by cheating on me too.. but now she’s pregnant with HIS baby..."
ImaLoserAndProud,c447nf,"Hey guys.
This story isn't *that* bad but it's not over yet. All I know is what happens in the story.


Cast:
Queen- My History teacher (This woman is a queen and nothing will change my mind)  


Mom- My Mother


Sister- My sis (won't be relavant except for the backstory


Brother- My idiot brother who watched this go down


Me/Op: Your's Truely.


Backstory-


When I was young my mom always told me to never have a YouTube channel. Never post, no commenting, only watching. I obeyed this rule until December 11th 2017 when I posted a speedpaint video. Then I went until August 2018 without telling any of my family about this channel of shitty art and animation. Oh yeah, I'm 13 by the way and my art did suck a ton when I was 11/12. After my brother's birthday I was thinking about telling my sister. Hell I had pins for this channel (my friend bought all of it and I'm was at like 35 subs at the time)


Me: Hey sis

Sis: Yea? What's up?

Me: I um… I have a YouTube channel…

Sis: Oh cool! 
 
Brother: *was listening* when you become famous I'm mooching off of you.

I laughed and we joked for a bit.


Few weeks back-


I had made this animation and was watching it in class (this was on amino not YouTube) and chose to show my teacher during freetime. She smiled and laughed at it's randomness and I told her about my YouTube channel. She poked fun at the name sayinf she would have made it really special spelling it Kandi instead of Candy (Whole thing is Candy Dash if you want to check it out) and she later watched some of my videos.


Present day-


We had to do a culminating project and I had done an animation instead of a slideshow like the other kids. We were about to go to the provided dinner when my mom started talking to my History/Advisory teacher.


Queen: OP is such an amazimg student in class. She's very bright and funny. (I don't find myself to be the funny type so this was a treat to hear)


Mom: That's great to hear.


Queen: And she showed me her little uh… animation YouTube channel. (She said this in a happy tone and only stuttered since she didn't know what to call it)


-my heart drops-


Mom: Oh. 


Queen: Well, I hope to see you around!


Mom: Same, have a good one!


Then we got dinner and left. My mom didn't say anything about my forbidden channel and I'm pretty scared that she'll take my phone away. 


TLDR: I made a YouTube channel against my mom's wishes, showed my teacher and my teacher accidentally snitched.",tifu,TIFU by allowing my mom to find out about my YT channel
Leon2060,bzyr91,"Just some basic background for y’all. During the summers I sell pest control door-to-door in the southern United States. Not the most luxurious job but definitely pays the bills for college the rest of the year.

A couple of weeks ago I was knocking through a neighborhood, ya know, being “that guy” and I come to a house with a smart home doorbell. Anyone familiar with these devices knows that they usually suck and are pretty finicky with the audio. A man answers and asks me a few questions about what we are doing etc. As I’m talking to him I hear a car come to an abrupt start and two (much larger than me) ladies jump out screaming “What the **** you doing!?” At this moment I’m hunched over this guys doorbell with terrible posture leaning against his front door thinking to myself that I’m about to be beat down while this guy watches through his camera!

As they approach me I shout  “Oh I’m sorry! Is this your husband I’m talking with through the doorbell?” Luckily they quickly realized what was going on and I didn’t get beat down. The lady told me after I sold her pest control that they were ready to beat me down thinking that I was trying to break into their house.

**P.S. Don't do drugs. They put you in bad situations, clearly.**

**TL;DR:** I'm 30 male and I asked out a 17 female. I realized my error in judgment and admitted it. My peers are still very upset with me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 30 and male. I have been working on a farm in the country side. It has been a fun time. They party daily and pretty hard. We did lots and lots of drugs. There's Aunt B (40?f), Mr Mr (48M, Farm owner) H&amp;H (22f&amp;24m, but they are basically always togeather). We get up in the morning, do drugs, do chores, more drugs, then we go to local pub and drink.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time I met D, Aunt B's daughter. D is a goth teen. She is not well taken care of by Aunt B. Aunt B has three children in total. D is her middle child and is 17. I met her at the farm doing drugs with her. I anonymous bought her family food once. D still was generous enough give it to other needy kids she knows. She's super tough, mentally and physically. She does all her own tattoos. She had been living in a car for the last week. Aunt B is also homeless but bums around the farm. So two days ago I ask D is she wanted to go to dinner. She said she couldn't that day. I said ""okay, maybe tomorrow"". She said ""Yeah"", then said later ""oof, I have to work"". I said ""that's cool, we can get something after"". She said ""I'll have to talk to my mom about it"".

So I was with Aunt B the next day. I was feeling weird about that morning being more on the sober side. So I asked Aunt b if she knew, and told I felt creepy about doing. I admitted my mistake. She wasn't immediately upset, and said that it was creepy and not to do that. I assured I wasn't and that it was an error in my judgement. Later she sneaks out with H&amp;H. Then they pull Mr. Mr. into it. I noticed everyone had disappeared. When I happened across them, the group scattered leaving just me and Aunt B. She said she was mad at me and to leave. So I left that day. This morning she has been telling me not to come back and has threatened me. I have yet to hear from H&amp;H and Mr. Mr. but I will be sending Mr. Mr. a text apologizing for bring drama to his home.

LlFE,c2nrkh,"Settle in, this will be a long read.

I've been watching the raptors for over two decades. I've only been to  three games in that period. I didn't have much money growing up and I  still don't have much now, but I cherish those memories in the air  canada centre, before it was renamed. I've never seen any of the players  up close so I convinced my best friend to come along to the parade for  what should be a once in a lifetime experience.

&amp;#x200B;

12am - Paradiso

We arrived at nathan philips square (nps) at midnight and found seats  that gave a great view of the stage, about three to four rows from the  front. The weather and atmosphere was amazing, the energy and enthusiasm  of the die-hard fans was electric. This was the best part of the whole  experience. People discussing basketball, having a laugh, chants fading  in and fading out, knock off championship tshirt merchants selling their  wares, food, coffee, everything. It was great.

&amp;#x200B;

3am to 5am - Purgatorio

I didn't feel like sleeping as the excitement was feeding that need.  Hardly anyone else was either. Some had foldable lawn chairs they were  comfortably sitting in, others had brought blankets or cardboard, but  most were sitting on the concrete floor which wasn't too bad because  weirdly the ground wasn't really cold. I sat there on the bare floor  thinking of the moments we would experience ahead. Lowry, Kawhi, Spicy  P. The Larry O'Brien trophy. As the temperature started to dip a little,  these thoughts kept me up. Slowly more and more people trickled in,  some trying to get ahead of others already there by finding empty areas  to cut in front and stand. No one said anything and minded their own  business. Also it was dark and hard to know who exactly was there from  before, left to get food, and came back.

&amp;#x200B;

5am - Inferno

The morning crew arrived and with them they brought chaos. The noise of  the commotion caused people to rush to as close to the stage as they  could get, which was barred by a temporary metal fence. People already  standing ran in front, people sitting on chairs or laying on blankets  were left behind. It was a free for all. Everyone squeezed into the  front and made everyone that was sleeping or on chairs get up or risk  being trampled. At this point everyone who wanted a good view was  standing, there was absolutely no place to sit. This sardine like  environment lasted for the whole event. Yes, that means people who you  saw at the front of nps close to the stage were standing their since 5am  with no chance to sit, lie down, rest, or go to the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

5:30am - 2 meters

New more robust fences were being placed and the temporary fences were  to be removed. Being right next to the fence allowed me to see  everything going on. Like a comedy they placed the new fences about six  meters ahead of the temp fences, got them set up, tore them down, moved  them up two meters, set them up, tore them down, and finally settled on  their final position of two meters from the current temp fences. So  between the permanent fences and the temporary ones, there was a gap of  two meters. As the crew, how do you remove the temporary fences knowing  that as soon as you remove one piece of a fence the crowd will gush in  like water? Answer: Have a crew member that's good with people work the  crowd and ask them not to move, another crew guy hold his position at  the end of the temporary fence piece, and two crew members to take the  temporary piece away. It goes like this, starting from the rightmost  temporary fence piece:

Crew Person A: ""This section, please do not move until I say so.....""

Crew Person B: Stands in the gap, at the end of the temporary piece holding his arms out

Crew Person C&amp;D: Go in gap and remove the fence

Crew Person A: ""ok move""

Crew Person B: Holds his ground so the people rushing in don't overflow into the gap in front of the next temporary fence.

I hope that paints a picture of the technique used. Surprisingly it worked well.

&amp;#x200B;

6am to 8am - Waiting

Final stage preparations got underway and we waited for the glory ahead.  The stage had two large sound systems and three screens. No video or  music was played and the crowd found ways to amuse itself. As an aside,  for the remainder of the event, the giant middle screen was never used  except for a video when the players arrived on stage. One crew guy was  pulling a giant screen behind the video. As he pulled with all his  might, the crowd (which now went beyond the TORONTO sign) began chanting  PULL PULL PULL. Anytime someone on stage would acknowledge the crowd we  would go wild. Almost every crew member got on stage at one time or  another and took a selfie with us in the background. Media starting  coming in and setting up in front of us to the sides. Chants for news  cast members broke out anytime recognizable faces appeared. BRANDON  BRANDON BRANDON.

&amp;#x200B;

8am to 10:30am - You had one job

I don't know much about djing, but the person on stage doing it was  probably the worst I've ever seen. Even after the sounds checks and  playing some strange video of silly dunks with the tune of Basketball by  lil bow wow, the dj would just stand there doing nothing (idling),  playing a few songs, idling, playing some an instrumental sample on  repeat for twenty minutes at a time. This lack of presence from the dj  continued throughout the event.

&amp;#x200B;

10:30am to 12:30pm - Waiting II

Random fireworks from people way in the back would bring everyone in  focus again. As far as I could see there were people, everywhere: on the  ground, in buildings seeing through windows, on top of buildings (yes  literally on the roof of skyscrapers as well). I've never seen anything  like this and probably won't ever again. Every place where you could  stand was packed. It was absolutely maddening how many people showed up  to this thing. Being on the ground in front of the stage we had no idea  at the level of the turnout. With such a concentration of people in the  same area, no one had cell data that would be any useful. Websites  wouldn't load. The icing on the cake was that the crowd had to start a  chant to get the organizers to put the parade on the screens. SHOW THE  PARADE SHOW THE PARADE SHOW THE PARADE. This chant would appear again  about five or six times throughout the event because the video screens  would be left idling on a screensaver after a short video of the live  parade.

&amp;#x200B;

12:30pm to 2pm - No love for the people

There were two or three times where they gave out shirts, flags,  miniature towels (do they have a name?), clappers, and those large faces  of players printed on cardboard. Most of the stuff were given to people  waiting on the side or in the middle. The raptors dances would throw  them as far as they could so the people at the front never got in on the  shirts. The other items were given mainly to the people on the sides  with only a handful to the people at the actual front of the stage. The  whole time I as there, they handed out water to maybe fifteen people in  the front. That's it. I saw only six or so water bottles given to people  dying of thirst, the rest eight or nine in small cups. Anyone not in  the front didn't have access to anything. People were fainting, I saw a  child being taken over the fence by security, passed out from heat  exhaustion. What should have been a cloudy day had lots of sun. I still  can't believe the lack of planning for an event like this. This is a  world class city, with mlse raking in billions and you packed millions  of people in nps like sardines with no food or water for the whole  event.

&amp;#x200B;

2pm - Stop climbing the arches

Announcements would be made from time to time, for example to ask people  to stop setting off fireworks. One such announcement was made to get  ten or twelve people off the arches in nps. It took about fifteen  minutes for this to happen. The event was put on hold because of it. The  clever people on top of the arches would listen, pace a few steps, and  start taking selfies again ignoring the orders by organizers. It took  boos from the crowd to have any effect on their minds.

&amp;#x200B;

3:00pm - VIP

At this moment, the people at the front of the stage have been standing,  with no chance to sit, for ten hours. Absolutely packed shoulder to  shoulder, no space to place your arm in front of you. This also means  that no one has gone to the bathroom for ten hours (more on this later)  as you'll lose you're place and have no chance of coming back with such a  large crowd (I can imagine the bathroom lines). The players were  scheduled to arrive at nps at 12:30pm. The sheer turnout with the  streets clogged made the parade slow down to a crawl. It took them five  hours to get from exhibition place to nps (in comparison an average car  ride from the two locations is ten to fifteen minutes). As the  procession came close to nps, the stage events got underway. Some  dancing, the national anthem, three rounds of planes flying overhead,  and finally the entrance of the team. In this time vip seats were taken  in the white chairs that were between the front of the stage and the  audience. I don't know who those people were but they came in thirty  minutes before the team did, were given food and plenty of water, smiles  from the organizers for their just being there. While we the audience  looked on without such necessities given to us. They would take selfies  with us in the background as everyone privileged enough to be in front  of the crowd, in front of the metal fences was doing. The pictures you  see with us in the background are of people posing in front of a blanket  of human agony, a can of human sardines, a canvas of pain. Ten hours of  standing, crammed into nps will do that to you.

&amp;#x200B;

3:30pm - The arrival

We caught glimpses of lord Ujiri, of St. Nick before the official  unveiling. The prime minister was the only person to come up close to  the crowds and greet them, starting from left to right, shaking hands  with the people reaching their arms from the front couple of rows. No  other player or organization member came close to us. The arrival kicked  off with introduction of dignitaries and then speeches and such,  accolades given out, a key to the city. Larry's speech was cutoff by a  message from Devlin, calming the audience for a situation that had  arisen. Looking back now, that event took place behind the TORONTO sign  in nps, but we in the front of the stage had no idea what was happening  in the back. There was no noise or anything, everything was drowned out  by the number of people there. Players and organization members were  given time to share a few words, green pitied himself, drake came on for  a bit, and then it was over. Just like that. It was actually a bit  surreal. The players just sat their on stage looking back at us. Most  weren't even smiling or looking like they were happy to be there. Lowry  and Kawhi just sat there, shades on their eyes, as serious as if they  were in a game being played. Actually most of the players didn't even  bother taking their shades off when addressing the crowd, which kind of  bothered me. We've been waiting for so long to see you guys, at least  show some respect to the fans I thought. Kawhi, probably the loudest the  crowd cheered for, gave us only a few words and ended it off with a  parody of his laugh. Post game interviews are longer than that. And this  was the championship parade finale. Looking back on these thoughts  about the players, i was completely wrong in my opinion. They went  through a lot 5 hours on the float with families, they were sure to be  exhausted as well and done by the time they got to nps. Im sorry if i  put anything on the players or organization.

&amp;#x200B;

5pm - Leaving

The crowd was hyping itself up with rumors that drake would perform. We  got a small speech and his plane. Nothing else was planned and the  parade fizzled out like that. Twelve hours of standing and it was over.  As the crowd departed, an unlimited supply of water bottles full of  urine and trash came into view. The streets were bustling with people  making their way home. Three of the nearest subway stations were closed  when the event ended. Looking back I was incredibly disappointed for how  the day turned out, like a bad taste that would be lingering for a long  time. I began questioning why I even went in the first place. Did I  like basketball and the raptors so much that I spent seventeen hours of  my life waiting to see faces up close that I'd only seen on tv or from  far away. Was that all there was to winning a championship until the  cycle again for next year? Was that all there was to basketball, to  sports?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know right now, but at this very moment I don't think I'll be  watching basketball anytime soon. I lost a part of myself attending this  parade.

I hope everyone made it back safely.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, my friend won't even message me back. Can't believe I made him go through hell.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Waited overnight at NPS, standing for 12 hours since 5am (no room to sit, lay down, washroom, or water) just to see the raptors on stage.

So me andy GF are often kinky, we like trying new stuff when it comes to sex since we're both young and inexperienced, and Madly in love so any kind of sex is amazing no matter what it is.

So we're lying in my bed, getting it on, and I remembered something, we talked about DP (double penetration) and she was excited to try it, and so was I. One of my 2 best friends got me a dildo as a gift from Japan, along with a very naughty pillow case so I knew we had the option, and I brought it up, she was excited to try and since we like shower sex, and we didn't know how this was gonna go we decided to combine the two...

Anyway, we begin, and I'm super excited, I imidiatly slide in, and we have some fun before I ruined it all... 

We've done anal before, and It was strange, so I decided I'd take the front and good ol' dildo will take the back... So I tell her to bend over and I sit down on my knees and start the penetration process...

I come back hours later, and my roommate has answered... In Russian. Just a simple ""that's very good"". This dude TOOK RUSSIAN A YEAR BEFORE ME AND I DIDN'T KNOW.

CorneliusAquarius,c7od8l,"This is a throwaway account and I apologize for any eventual grammatical errors; english is not my mother tongue. Also, written on mobile.

This happened yesterday. But as per usual, context first:

I live as a straight male; people who know me, know me as straight. Except from my girlfriend who knows that I'm bisexual, who has also even participated in some ""devil's threesomes"" (whereas I, yes, along with her, act as bottoms to the other top male). It's great! We're moving in together in a month, we connect very well, and we have a bomb ass sex life.

I'm 20 years old and I've been sexually straight always. That is, until about two years ago, on an MDMA trip, where me and my best friend ended up having gay sex, both of us high as hell. Turned out to be a one time thing for him, but not for me. Ever since then, I've realized more and more, day by day, that I am also into guys. Until now it's purely sexual, and not romantical/amorous or whatever you'd call it. What I mean is, I get turned on by the thought of - and actually having penetrational/oral sex with men. BUT, there's nothing in it for me when it comes to kisses, cuddles, compliments (during sex) etcetera. But the gay-side of my sexual endeavours seem to develop for every experience so nothing about it is resolute. At first I couldn't even confidently handle the partner's hands upon my body, whereas now kisses and such are becoming slightly enticing to me. 

Nevertheless, today was one of the days I felt like having sex with a man. As with my situation, some days I can't even imagine myself in bed with another man, and yet the next day I may be super into it. I guess it's a process. Whatever. 

I hit this guy up, who's 8 years older than me, that I'd been exchanging dialogue with for about two years. We met once, like 18 months ago. It ended in amazing oral sex and that was about it. Most often our chats are centered around sex, our separate affairs and how we should get together for another ""real"" session, so to speak. We'd even sometimes talk to eachother about guys he or I had slept with, basically sharing experiences.

I should probably also mention that the man in question lives the same way I do, when it comes to disguising one self as a straight male. He realized he was bisexual a couple of years ago and still keeps it to himself. His business, so I wont go on any further on that. 

He's very nice, careful, talks about interesting things and what not. He's also an objectively great looking guy, it's obvious that he works out and he has a manlyhood-size way above average. What a catch, right?!

90% or so of the time I participate in gay sex, I'm the bottom. That's what's attractive to me. If I want to be top/dominant, I engage in the girl-side of the sex-spectrum. So, being the bottom, I shaved the area of entering, performed an amateur enema and lotioned myself up so I'd be as clean, soft and rinse as possible.

Well, after much anticipation and blah blah blah I'm finally stood at his door. I shoot him a message and a minute later he welcomes me in. He's still as great looking as when I last saw him, and he still seems like a very normal guy, greeting me with a genuine smile, asking me about my day, trying to make meaningful conversation at first instead of going straight to ravaging eachother's sexual areas; as in the contrary, that's how most gay-internet-community people meet up. ""Great!"", I thought. I can go into this with full confidence. And so I fucking did.

After a couple of beers and some absorbing conversation, we started getting into ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) the sex ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Oral was just as good as last time, and with this guy I was actually very comfortable with him expressing how good it was in a sexual way. I was so excited! After like 5 minutes, he **lifted me off the couch**, carried me to his bedroom and threw me on his bed. *Oh man, I've never had this of an intimate and passionate gay experience before*, I thought to myself as my mind and heart started racing even faster. He proceeds to kiss and caress my body, and a moment later I'm on top of him. As the penetrational sex begins it feels so good and the heat of the moment really captivated me. Just a few seconds into it he grabs me by my neck and my hair, pulls me in close and starts making out with me (*just as I'd do with a girl... huh...*, I thought to myself). 

So, we were in bliss (well atleast I was), and I felt like I had discovered something very new for me in the gay-sex scene. It was full-blown sex, and I was amazed of how well it went and how comfortable he made me feel.

After a few minutes he says he wants to switch positions, to which I agree, but oh man here we go. During those minutes of anal sex we had had, his dick had not ""popped""/pulled out of me yet, since that's pretty common when having anal sex due to the tightness. I was riding him, and as he pulls out, my ""supposed-to-be-clean-arse"" rips a huge grainy fart, followed by some proper leaking. Let's just say we where both paralyzed for a brief moment, before I, in a loud sigh go ""Oh... MAN..."" and he looks down in terror and replies ""Yeah... That's one way to put it"". 

You know the bodily fluid that goes out of your ass after passing through the digestive system? Otherwise known as poop/crap/shite/defecation/fecal matter? Yeah. That was all over him and his (may I add, expensive mattress and) bed. And since I had performed an enema earlier, it was NOT. SOLID. AT. ALL. And as the cadence of the fart suggested, it was literally sprayed all over him from his ballsack to his feet. 

I loudly and clearly said ""*You stay right there, lay down, close your eyes and hold your nostrils shut. Give me a minute and I will FIX this.*"". He softly replied ""Ok"", and then I ran to his bathroom, turned on the shower and grabbed a whole roll of toilet paper. Coming back to the bedroom in a hurry, he was already stood up, with my liquid defecation running down his legs and feet. 

He showered, I cleaned his bedroom and the path to his bathroom, and after like 10 minutes we sat down in his living room couch, simultaneously sighing and actually burst out in laughter. Both of us completely naked with extremely flaccid penises. We ended up having some more beers together, talking about the fucked up situation amongst other things, and then we called it a night.

The thing is, when I did the enema beforehand, I was anticipating my not-knowing family to come home any second so I did it in one hell of a rush. Turns out I partly didnt't clean myself fully, and that I partly didn't let all of the water exit my backpassage. Lesson learned.

**TLDR:** I had the best gay sex I'd ever had with the greatest guy I'd ever met (sexually) and it ended with me spraying my bodily fluids all over him.",tifu,TIFU by administrating an enema in a rush and then proceeding to have gay sex
conquering69,by7pdm,"I’m one of those practical people so at home, especially in the morning, I will sit on the toilet to pee. It’s easier, cleaner, and more quiet (I don’t know why more men don’t do it). Anyway, my penis was about 3/4 hard coming down from morning wood as I sat down. Unfortunately, this was one of those lengthy pisses from not going all night. Went on for about a minute haha and apparently raised the tide in the bowl. So towards the end I have this strange feeling of wetness on my tip and about two seconds later I realize what’s happening and jump up. I process what just happened (very good wake up mechanism, btw) and then decide that I need to shower immediately haha. Of course, as I’m showering the idea of posting this hilarity on this sub hits me and here we are.

Lesson learned: If you’re a dude and you’re going to piss sitting down on the toilet, beware of the rising tide!

BadLuckStripClubGoer,c7tgm4,"Throwaway account as I've been relatively active on my main one. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, I decide to go to a local strip club after work. The night starts off fine enough, I get a drink, one of the ladies comes up to me, we hang out at the bar for a few minutes, talk the usual strip club small talk, etc.  After about 10-20 minutes of this, we have a few lap dances together. As things progress along, she tended to get a lot more playful and adventurous in her moves and dances. By about the 4th dance, she decided to make a flirtatious move where she started to fall down to the ground and apparently wanted me to catch her.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't. I was sort of zoned out in the moment, and she never told me what to do. In addition, I have a habit of not being the best at reading non-verbal cues or language. As a result, when she made this move, she fell pretty much straight down to the ground with me just sort of staying there while it happened. She told me afterward she hit her head a little bit, and because of the way I was holding her hand when she fell, my hand went down pretty suddenly with the fall. I injured my finger as a result, and ended up being in pretty significant pain for 24-48 hours. The finger still doesn't have 100% motion back either, about two weeks after the fact. The security team at the club was also pretty close to kicking me out, because having only seen her fall and me near by, didn't know what was going on. I profusely apologize to her, luckily she seems to understand enough, and the security team realized it was just an accident, but I still felt incredibly guilty and embarrassed, so I finished the last dance we were at before the accident, pay her, and go home. I think I ended up kind of lucky in that moment that things didn't end up much worse, and I'm grateful for the girl who I was with that she was nice enough throughout that whole accident. Not sure I'm going to go to that club again for awhile, just to be safe.

TL;DR: Went to a strip club, stripper wanted me to catch her while dancing, I didn't, we both were hurt a bit and I almost got kicked out.",tifu,TIFU by going to a strip club
drumstickyeetaway,c5jdi3,"First things first: obligatory this is a throwaway account as my main is known and this did not happen today but a few years back.

So now to the good stuff. I was a horny kid, did stuff I wasn’t proud of. One such occasion really has stuck with me though, for reasons about to be told. So jerking off is great, I did it a bit, not a whole lot though. This was because I didn’t know what an orgasm was and when I was about to ejaculate I thought I would pee. American Sex Ed is not good at all. So, since I never came, I never really got a dopamine rush. But there were other methods. I LOVED butt stuff. I would stick several fingers up my ass and even look up tricks to make it easier. So I loved fingering myself and swirling my fingers around in my asshole. But i could go  only go so far with my knuckles being in the way from a full fist. Ya boi’s first dildo was a hairbrush. It was great, I loved it. But I can go further, I NEEDED it to go far because it was a sensation like nothing else. I have a drummer in my family and there were drumsticks everywhere. I grabbed one of the marching sticks and went to my room. I set the mood, getting naked and setting down a towel (I am not a savage) to prepare my rectum. However if you guys know marching sticks, they are taped up (which is why I chose them, plus they are thicker) but they are beat up a ton. Dumbass me didn’t think about the uneven surface of the stick head and just went for it. Mild discomfort going in, I will not lie, but then I stuck it in farther and went up and down VERY fast. 


oh fuck was that a bad idea. I’m only assuming hundreds of shards of wood peeled off of the half broken stick and fell into my anal cavity, rupturing anything that it was pressed against. I felt that for sure, and out of fear I ripped the stick out, jamming more shards into my butt entrance. so here I lay, a young teenager covered in sweat, holding a disgusting drumstick, and with an asshole lined with wood. I used my fingering tactics to try and get most of them out, which succeeded, but there were still several that had to come out naturally which did cause quite some discomfort...


TLDR: Horny teen me shoved a drumstick up my ass. The stick was partially broken since it was used in marching band and wood shards covered my anal cavity. Fingered my self to get most out but some took their sweet time.",tifu,TIFU by sticking a drumstick in my anus and giving myself splinters inside my asshole
PooferFugu,byxmhc,"So last night I was with my friend on discord, we were having a good time talking about pride month, I told her I was non-binary and she told me she was bisexual.  all was well and good when i decided to tell her something that I was told not to, and i wish now more than ever that I obeyed my mothers wishes and didn't tell her.  When I got home from my friends house earlier my mom was telling me that she felt so uncomfortable around my friends dad, that I wasn't allowed to go to her house anymore.  WTF?  My friend's dad never did anything to me, he keeps to himself and doesn't bother us when I come over.  She told me that I could have my friend over to my house, but not the other way around..  My friend's dad has autism, by the way.  So back to me and my friend were talking about pride month.  It was getting really deep and personal when I felt ""she should know"" I was loopy and it was past midnight so I wasn't thinking straight (heh straight)  So I tell her the easy way ""Basically your dad makes her feel uncomfortable.. to the point where I'm not allowed to come over anymore.""  instant regret, she doesn't take it well.  She goes silent.  I panic and think ""Fuck! fuck I shouldn't have said anything!!""  I message her and say ""\*Friend's name\*, Are you there?  Im sorry.. i felt like you should know..""  she replies ""Yeah im here, but i have to go to school, last day, ya know?  ttyl!""  then i tell her goodnight and say ""((even though youre gone:  my mom has a timer, and after a while she calms down and lets things happen, she said she'll let you come over here, which means we can still go to friendly and five below and all the good stuff.  we'll find a way to work around this.  she cant stop us from being prideful friends.   i  was told to not tell you any of that, but i really needed to..  you have the right to know whats going on.  I hope this doesnt affect you or us in any way....  goodnight, again..))""  she responds ""Ok, im back for like five seconds, i want to thank you for being such an amazing friend and i love you (as a friend of course)  Prideful friends for life!  Ok now real i have to go.  Gn""  Maybe she is fine because she said ""Maybe your mom will cool off and let you come over again?"" after she said she had to go..  IDK!  I feel like I really should have not told her but then again she deserved to know, right?  Can someone give me advice?  I don't know what I'm going to do and I don't want our friendship to end cause she was my best friend!

404randguy,c1fb3s,"This did not happened today but few years ago. And throwaway account 'cause. 

There's me, first year at university with all the stuff going well. Meeting new people, discovering beer, getting drunk, growing up and evolving myself as a human being.

It's tuesday night, not raining, not windy, unusual for Mid November where it happened.

Nearly 8pm, and I'm walking home planning my night 'cause the morning I have calculus exam that values 10% of final grade. Honestly, a lot for single exercise. But I had to pass with good results and really enjoyed math, so I planned : get home, cook something fast to eat, smoke some quality stuff, play PS and then study a little during the night. Yah, quite random but I was getting results following that method. 

I got home and, let's call him Gary, one of my housemates (we were 5, important stuff) asked me if I wanted to join him and a couple to dinner. Gary, I got to know on the university's opening day and he was a nice guy - for the record,  I'm not gay, important again.
This couple were my friend Tom That I knew for ages and Mary that I recently get to know - important stuff, sorry to admit in front of you all but she was kinda sexy.

I accepted but told that I had to study later on.

1 am, and the dinner went well, some good pasta, good wine, chilling on the kitchen, with Gary as our personal DJ. Mary seemed to a nice girl, open minded with no bullshit conversation with no boring topics. At this point we are alone at home. Unusual again.

Gary says that he is going to take a damp and the rest went to smoke a cig and take a coffee on the balcony.

20 minutes passed and no signal of him. We got in the house, and as soon as I drink some wine my body just feels the necessity of expelling some butt stuff. 

At this precise moment, I went on a journey to find a bathroom. Gary still occupied, he had the time to wank 5 time but I never ever asked him. 

My front neighbor were using their toilet, and 2 of others that I knew of where not at home. 

I get back to the balcony, alone and trying to relax. But no. I still think on the subject, I'm anxious, and all from a sudden I look to one corner of our balcony and "" Why not damp from the 4th floor to the ground? Well, I see nobody here and on the campus"". Yeah! My house gad directly front view for all campus. 

Remember : not raining and not windy.

Here he goes the superman, alone still, get trousers down. Two foot supporting on the first safety bar. My hands grabbing the second bars. The butt is not touching anything. My cheeks were completely free, and it felt so good. 
Anyway, here I'm all prepared and start relaxing and the shit starts to know the real world.

Well, don't know why but god just changed his mind.

The wind starts to arouse my ass, my legs, my nuts and Mr. Warrior. 
I get goosebumps, start to cold down. 
My anus contract, and the material just stop getting out. Oh gosh.

I just try to push the maximum I could. 

Still alone, and I listen to the front door opening. I prayed a lot. And, all of my housemates just appear on the balcony!!!! Looking at me, surprised of course. They just start laughing and asking the whys. F******* Gary just ask the whys, btw... Well, I explained everything. 

3 of my housemates, trying to support my body and giving me support to continue and conquer the world. 

I got focused and here I go? 

Well, no. I look forward and I notice that Mary is there, looking perplex at me. She looks to my penis, then to my face, all again, like a loop...

Know I have 2 tasks. Drop it from the balcony as I have to control my Warrior because of Mary.

My Warrior just has a brain and as soon I saw her, Mr. Warrior just try to get the sword up. 
Really ashamed, but she still there faithful to her position with the wind just getting worst. 

After an effort, I controlled the situation upfront and focused on the back. 

Finally I was able to damp the material. I remember, that due to the wind, one piece just went to the balcony under ours. Another, got smashed on the ground.
No questions after that 

Not proud of what I have done. Never ever again I will repeat it.

The exam went well, had the 10%. 


TL;DR : night before test, no toilet available on the apartment, went to damp at the balcony when alone. Ending up with some people watching me, supporting and my friend's girlfriend watching me maintaining control of Mr. Warrior",tifu,TIFU by planning my night and do not commit to it
FlyingElvii12,c0njsi,"I need a second to calm down, this just unfolded.

It's my day off, and sports are on. I'm taking it easy and enjoying life. Since I'm the only one home until later in the evening, I decided to toke up and relax. 

After my smoke session, I suddenly felt the urge to clean some of my glass pipes since it's been a while. I get the gunk out, boil the water, and place both pipes into the pot. After I do that, I put the remains of a salad into a plate and set it on the counter (becomes relevant later).

Here comes the plot twist........

After about 15 minutes, I come into the kitchen to check the progress. As I stand at the stove, I look toward the front door. You can imagine my astonishment when I see my mom walking onto the porch. Like a deer in headlights, I panic. 

Fortunately, my mom was looking down while standing on the porch. In that moment, I manage to grab one pipe (with tongs, I'm not an idiot!), conceal it under a bag and turn off the stove.

My mom walks in saying she got cut loose early. She looks at the pot and asks if I'm cooking. I smile and say no, muttering something about boiling water. Amazingly, she just looks at me and says ""OK"", smiles and looks at the salad I've made. 

Somehow, having the salad out distracts her from pursuing the BW investigation any further. I say something about it being lunchtime (I've inexplicably not eaten anything so far today). 

Right after saying that, my younger brother walks into the kitchen. Apparently he's come over to assemble a grill (Father's Day present). While he and my mom begin to do that, I scramble to take out the second pipe, put that in a bag and walk into my bathroom. After stowing the pipes, I go back into the kitchen and throughly clean the pot. 

Now I'm sitting in my living room watching the US Open while my brother and my mom eat lunch before starting on the grill. I gotta say, that was one close call and got extremely lucky that neither one saw the glass pipes.

And that salad? DELICIOUS!!!!

It's important to know that I am female and my gym teacher at the time was male.

So it's gym class and I didn't participate bc I was sick or something. My classmates played a game and afterwards my teacher wanted to explain something. Him and I were sitting on a bench that has no backrest so he was sitting with each leg on one side of the bench and I was too, at the moment right behind him. He gets up to explain something, everyone else gathers to listen to him. He still stands with the bench between his legs so there is a great triangle between his butt, the legs and the bench.

Now I fuck up: My stupid kid brain thought, it was funny if i put my head into that triangle. So I do and say, in a really happy voice ""hello"" to the students and the teacher who were all looking at me in shock. Some giggled, but almost everyone cringed. I pull me head back and he continues his explanation.

In that moment I felt like I accomplished something great. But now, more than 10 years later I still cringe from that thought. My classmates were obviously weirded out by it but soon after forgot about it, I think. And I am so glad, nobody, except for me and probably the teacher, remember this.

So I work in the marijuana industry in Colorado as a budtender (yes, it is the best job ever and no, I don’t get high on the clock).

So this lady comes in yesterday and one of my coworkers hands her off to me and I start talking to her and finding her products she wants. I can’t remember what she bought but our conversation drifted into pop culture/movies. At some point I brought up Endgame and, in trying to be witty about something I don’t remember, I quoted ‘I am Iron Man’ from the movie and snapped my fingers. She had a blank stare on her face and just kinda went along with it, clearly not having gotten the reference. So I asked her if she’d seen Endgame. 

Her response?

“No, I haven’t.”

Panic bells start going off in my head. I have just *ruined* the poetic ending of Avengers: Endgame and I can’t tell her without outing myself as having just fucked up in a social situation again (something I’m constantly doing at work and my coworkers are always giving me shit about).

CummyBoner,bz24zq,"This didn't happen today, but last week.
For some background, I am definitely interested in a plethora of fetishes, that most would say aren't normal. Some of these include ball busting, penis/genital cutting, general masochism, and much more. 

So last week, I started talking to a guy on grindr that had similar interests in his bio. We chatted for a bit and began planning to meet up to do some of this stuff, as it would be his first time. He said we could do this at his house, which was great because my grandma was home at the time. 

When I arrived at his house, we began discussing what we would like to do. And he suggested doing a roleplay of a doctor performing a botched circumsision on a patient. We weren't gonna do an actual circumsision, just light cutting. I sat in his bathtub, naked and he entered dressed in a doctor costume he presumably acquired beforehand. He had various surgery tools that looked really legit. We began to roleplay starting by chatting as if it was a doctor visit, then it was time for the main act. He took one of the scalpel, he called it a ""number 4"" and he started to make small incisions on my foreskin. This was great, but for one cut, he went way too deep and ended up cutting my frenulum as well. I began to bleed profusely and he freaked out and suggested I went to hospital. I panicked and wrapped my dick in toilet paper, put my clothes on and ran out. I got into my car debating on what should I do, I went home in fear of embarrassment at the hospital. When I got home, I douced my dick in hydrogen peroxide and kept it wrapped up in medical tape. I am sitting here panicking because I'm in fear of getting an infection, but also in fear of going to the hospital.

Lessedrone,c64g24,"Ok so first of all, this happened about 6 month ago, and i think it’s important to say that i’ m not traumatized, i laugh about it with my friends and i’m just glad not to be dead or injured.

Im from France so my english might not be good but i will do my best.

I was a 16 (now 17) years old male when this happened.

So, i skipped two years of school because i was a precocious child, so i ended up having my baccalauréat (idk the us equivalent) at 16 years old. Because i was 2 years younger than everyone else and because i was really weird and skinny, i was bullied between my 10 and 14 years old. One day, because of a long and uninteresting story, i realized how lame i was and decided to be a better version of myself. I cut my hair (i had really long hair), saw a nutritionist, i was doing a lot of sport, learn on youtube how to have good posture, good style etc.

This worked a lot and i ended up having a girlfriend at 15 and being much more confident than before (also bullying stopped). But, i always wanted to be more and more confident. I ended up this year on a how to beast video showing the program « Bold 30 », 

Basically, every day you have one challenge for 30 days, that gets harder and harder (it’s starts by calling a pizzeria and asking for a movie recommendation and ends by asking to a group of girl the number of one of them). I bought this program because it sounded amazing and started doing it. 

During this months, i lived some of the best experiences ans encounters in my life, and because you do this every day, you start to have a « momentum » of confidence.


So, here we begin : 

I was doing the program for about 20 days (i think it was number 23) and so i wake up on the morning to see the following challenge : « ask 3 guys to take a selfie with you », so i go to school and at about 8PM i take the subway and go to Paris (precisely Bercy, because it’s a place i know well). I ask two random for a selfie, it works im happy bla bla bla, and then i go for the last guy.

 I found a black dude, approximately 30 years old, who looks cool and i ask him for a selfie. Then he asks « do you know where i can find the subway » and because i needed to go home i said « Yes, i go there too follow me ». So we discuss a little during the path, he tells me that he is from the city Lyon in the south of France, and that he missed his train and that the next train is at 3 am, so he asks me if i wanted to go eating with him. 
Because im in the momentum and because all of my encounters were great, i said yes and we go at Chateau Rouge together. (he is a barman and a cooker and chateau rouge is a place with a lot of African restaurants).
During the past, we talked a lot, he admired my motivation to be more confident, and i liked his insane knowledge about cookery.

He pay me a beer, while we are on the path, the we smoke some weed because he had some, he asks my age, i tell him 16, he laughed because he didn’t believe me, and we moved on. We go eating to the restaurant, he pays me food, we talk a lot and overall it was a really great moment. Because he was acting like a cool friend, and because i was a little too confident, drunk and high, i didn’t asked myself why he was so kind to me.

Then while we went out of the restaurant, he tells me « that was so cool to know you, but i would like to go to a sauna before returning to Lyon, you can come if you want, i don’t force you at all » and i said « hell yeah » because i was so happy about this totally spontaneous and random situation, and because i thought it was so cool to go to a sauna at about 10pm.
So i follow him and i see he looks a little bit nervous, and he kept asking « are you really 16?, you look so mature » but i didn’t thought about it because i just took that as a compliment.
So we walk to the sauna at Châtelet, and he says right before entering « you have to know though that it’s a gay sauna, i go there because it’s more peaceful ». So i said « yeah no problem » but i realize now that i was fucking stupid, but hey, i like getting out of my comfort zone.

I just want to say that i never went before to any gay sauna, and that it’s not really « peaceful » for a straight guy. Basically that’s not a sauna, it’s just a place where everyone are fucking. 

So i enter in the sauna and everyone looks at me, bite their lips, and do whisper comments that i cannot translate (for my french bois, it was approximately some « qu’es ce que tu va prendre ma salope »)(i have a rather feminine face so i assume that’s why)

So my friend buy me a ticket, and the cashier gives me a bracelet, with inside a condom (this is the moment when i started to understand). I then go in the locker room where to young guys pinch my butt and says to my friend « im gonna steal you girlfriend ». So as i can imagine i start to be a little scared and my friend says « don’t worry, they will do nothing if im here » so i follow him as close as possible.

We go to a hammam where everyone is standing and masturbating while looking at each other. I go out, and my friend follow me. He says that he is sorry and that he didn’t know it was that  hardcore. I tell him that i will be more confortable in a place with only he and i, so we go to the smoking room, where there is nobody else. We start smoking weed and i become more and more calm and safe. I start thinking, about this crazy night, about my cool new friend etc. Then, i suddenly look at my friend, and i saw that he is masturbating. I tells me that he was sorry for lying to me and that he was gay. I answer that there is no problem, but i that it’s uncomfortable to me. Then he said « oh, let me » so i stand up and went for the locker room in order to go home. 

While im dressing up he runs for me telling that he is sorry, and that he knows it’s inappropriate for him to do that. I calm down and he asks me to follow him. I follow him, we go upstairs to a place with a lot of little padded places. We sit in one of them and he close the door (i wasn’t realizing at all what was happening, i just followed because idk, i guess i was shy to say no).

Then, he start to tell me that when he saw me in bercy, i charmed him, and that he fell in love with me, etc. Then he go for a hug. I just want to say that im not at all repulsed in having sex with a guy, i mean, why not try; but the weird sentimental relation he created, and the hug, highly repulsed me. 
So i pushed him away with a lot of force, and he looked at me with a lot of anger (that i never seen before in him) and he said « then i want my money back ». I stand up and just say « donner c’est donner reprendre c’est voler » (which can be translated by « giving is giving, take back is stealing ») and walk to open the door. Right before i open the door, he slap me in the face with an insane force, that make me fall down.

Then i don’t remember precisely, i just remember him turning me, taking my butt and fucking my ass while i was just immobile. I was too chocked to move, and i didn’t want to because i didn’t wanted him to be even more violent. It didn’t hurt, it was just humiliating and nasty. 

After about 10 minutes (maybe less, it looked really long to me) he just stopped, said « im sorry » and ran out. I stayed there immobile for about 20 minutes, than woke up, went to the locker room and left. I slept instantly when i was at my home.

The next day i woke up, and started thinking about what happened. It almost looked like a dream to me. I open my phone and saw that he left me a sms (i gave him my number at the restaurant) he said « Hey mister selfie, i hope you don’t regret meeting me yesterday, i would love to see tou again » which was so creepy because it looked like nothing happened. I deleted him from my contact and i decided that this event will not impact my life in any bad way, so i call a friend, told him the story and we laughed about it.

Tl dr : i had a program with some challenges to get out from my comfort zone. I asked to a random guy a selfie, he invite me to go to a restaurant with him, he made me drink and smoke. I asked me if i wanted to follow him in a gay sauna. I said yes, followed him, and he raped me.",tifu,"TIFU by wanting to get out of my comfort zone, talking with a cool guy in a street and ended up being raped"

Pretty concerned I'd be terrible if I got into a serious relationship now. What if I've just gotten comfortable with being by myself and not knowing how to open up you know?



So wanted to start dating again and learn through experiences both good and bad.
I thought I'd try and get back on the Tinder ecosphere without half-assing it this time as well. Get a proper bio on, be honest about what I'm looking for and see how lady luck favours me with them swipes. Pray my pictures display some form of cuteness a person would like to see IRL and get to know.  



While setting it up again I thought of even getting a month of Tinder Plus. I've got a decent job and the fee for the first month wouldn't hurt that much, plus I could cancel at any point. Little did I know I was subscribing for humiliation far worse than incessant left swipes.


I'm sharing Apple Music with a friend acting as the organizer. (God bless her soul for that cause I'm finding **so many bops** with it). So as a result, all payments would automatically be taken from one card unless the organizer adds another one. Family members cannot add or delete a card either. 


*Information I clearly didn’t know because I thought my card would still be part of the account details and no one else would know of this transaction*



Cut to a few minutes ago I get a message from said friend wondering why the heck a Tinder subscription was being charged against her account. With a screenshot of that little red 🔥 in a neat old receipt. Gotta give Apple credit for presentation. 



Reddit I swear to God, I'd rather she'd found my porno collection  over this. I called her up and apologized profusely with the same porno simile mentioned. She was initially confused, but found it hilarious once she found out why it happened. Was cool with it as well thankfully.  So yay made someone laugh genuinely on a Monday. Suck on that, Garfield. 


Told her I'll transfer the month's fee the moment it got deducted from her account. Cancelled the subscription as well to avoid the recurring fee. I'll settle for limited swipes as karma for this whole drama. Sitting in office now just embarrassed over the whole ordeal. So yeah that's been my Monday. 


CHECK WHO'S CARD IS PAYING FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS ON APPLE Y'ALL. DON'T TAKE THIS EMBARRASSMENT BULLET LIKE I DID.

So there used to be this uncle who was really playful with kids (especially me) and I just liked him a lot. Whenever I see him, I would run upto him and have him hold my hands at the wrist and then proceed to climb while being completely upright. Kinda like how Jackie Chan or Tom cruise would climb a builting, as if just walking vertically.

I would start at his feet, all the way upto the waist. But this one time, I decided to push it a bit too far and climbed a bit more than I should have. All of a sudden I was completely upside down, and on the way to getting there ending stamping on my uncle's chin. A special kinda upper cut with feet. 

He fell backward while I was still being upside down and we both fell on our backs. I was relatively unscathed, but he got a very very sore chin and neck. That's the last time he let me do that and I regret it a lot since I had quite a bit of my childhood left to do that again.

RockyTgames,by7e1x,"Some background to begin with: my fiancee and I have been best friends for 4 years, have been dating for 2, and been engaged for almost a year. She proposed to me in Baskin Robin's after I'd gotten into a very minor car accident a few hours prior. I was given a wedding band and immediately I asked what kind of ring she'd like. She told me that she was a size 8 and all she really wanted was a pretty Walmart ring. She was dead serious. So I picked one out for her and she loved it. The only problem was that it started to turn green pretty quickly. So I was gonna get her a very nice one for her birthday as a surprise.


TLDR: She's only had fake rings and I wanted to get her a real one. 


So I went to Belk to get her a nice sterling silver ring, and I picked one out that was size 8. Because it made sense to me that I should get the same size as Walmart rings. I bought it, and held onto it (and the receipt) for a few months until the big night. Last night we stayed up until midnight and I gave her the ring as soon as the clock changed. I showed her the box and she had the biggest grin on her face. Then she opened it. She said it was beautiful and then educated me on the fact that ring sizes aren't consistent depending on the type you buy. Why size 8 doesn't equal size 8, I will never know. We took it out of the box attempting to see if it fit anyway. No luck. So now we will be going to Belk in hopes that we can exchange it for a bigger size.

A couple of weeks ago I (I’m a guy) ordered some things on sale from an outdoors website. When packing my order they included free samples of men’s deodorant. I am blessed because I don’t really get much B.O. therefore I don’t use deodorant. so I figure why waste perfectly good deodorant? I gave it to my fiancé (she’s a gal). 

That was my fuck up. 

This morning she was getting ready for the day. She had just showered, used the aforementioned deodorant, started to get dressed when things got a little frisky in our bedroom. She didn’t have enough time to get undressed again, just to have to get re-dressed so she decided she was just gonna put her hair up and “take care of me”. 

AWESOME! I thought to myself... Saturday morning BJ, nothing can bring me down today, or so I thought. 

As she’s taking me to town, full on sloppy apple bobbing, all I could smell is men’s deodorant. Totally threw a wrench in the gears. Every time I closed my eyes it felt exactly how it seemed, I’m getting blown by someone wearing men’s deodorant. FML.

Jerked_off_to_BF,byj12n,"This actually happened yesterday, unlike most stories here. On mobile so I apologize for any formatting errors. 

**BACKGROUND**

So about a year and a half ago, we were just chilling at her place. I forgot I had a homework assignment due at midnight, so she let me use her computer to do it.

Well her homepage was reddit and I noticed she had over 900 messages. I knew she Reddits but the first thing that came to my mind was “Man, she has to be a karma whore to the extreme; what the fuck does she comment on?” So I went to her profile when I discovered, oops, that was her NSFW account. In my defense, we know each other’s Reddit handles and send each other posts all the time; I just thought it was a regular account. When I realized it wasn’t, I x’d out almost immediately, finished my homework, and then just left it at that.

A week later, I was feeling horny, and I remembered about her account. It took a bit of digging, but I managed to find her account again, and spanked it to her. Ever since, I pretty much regularly masturbate to her. It’s not that I want to have sex with her, BUT she is hot, and the taboo nature of looking at someone I knew kept it alluring.

Anyways, I majored fucked up when hanging out with her yesterday. Her boyfriend’s birthday was coming up, and she asked what she should give him. Like an idiot, I answered “you should give him a strip tease with those fishnets you have.” IDK why the fuck I said that; I had fishnets in my head because I spanked it that morning, and I forgot to realize that it was actually HER who posted a picture of herself in fishnets a couple days ago. She asked “how did I now she had fishnets” and I tried to just say I was joking, but I eventually admitted I knew her NSFW account.

She asked for how long and I was honest; for the better part of a year. She was **furious**.  She said those pictures are private pictures, and that they were not meant for my eyes. She said if I found her account, I should’ve just pretend I didn’t, and that she feels gross and violated and she wanted me to leave.

**FUCK UP**

Telling her was actually my first fuck-up, but the REAL fuckup was posting on Reddit about it. When I did, I INSTANTLY got bombarded with messages saying I’m a piece of shit and people who I die because I’m a disgusting, perverted freak. I’m not going to lie; I knew I fucked up about it big time, but I didn’t realize the gravity of the situation. 

After posting, I felt like a HUGE piece of shit. I decided, I was going to take a step back from the friendship. First, I wanted to apologize. I wanted to apologize to her for obvious reasons, but I decided that I also wanted to apologize to her boyfriend for disrespecting their relationship. 

So I tried calling her. She understandably didn’t answer, so I  decided to text her a huge apology instead. I then decided to call her boyfriend to apologize to him personally. Her boyfriend is actually an acquaintance of mine, which is also why I felt like I should apologize. 

To my surprise, he did pick up. I told him that I was sorry about everything and I’ve crossed some serious boundaries and that I’ll step away from the friendship if it’d make him comfortable. 

Well, he was completely confused and asked me to clarify. I told him that I figured my friend told him what happened, but the gist was that I found her NSFW account and hid it from her, and I violated her trust and I’m sorry. 

Well, he had absolutely NO idea what NSFW account I was talking about. We went back and forth but I realized; she was probably posting these without him knowing. I had no idea; I just assumed because they were dating, she’d of course tell him. 

Well, the cat was already out of the bag. So I came clean; I told him about the NSFW account and sent him the link. I felt like he deserved to know that his girlfriend was posting nudes behind his back for at least a year. 

He appreciated the fact that I told him, and he views as what she did as cheating, and confided is me that he’s going to break up with her.  I feel horrible for causing all of this drama. I’m a shit friend, and most definitely lost one of the best I’ve had, even if she was cheating. 

This all happened yesterday. I felt like a piece of shit yesterday, and I still do today. But at least one less person is getting cheated on. 

**FAQS** 

I posted this on amitheasshole originally yesterday (spoiler alert: I am). But I had a lot of repeated questions so I’ll address them preemptively

&gt;	Why did you ruin her relationship you perverted fuck?

I didn’t tell him to hurt her. Like I said, I was planning on stepping away from the friendship. Which is why I said I’ll step away from the relationship. 

I told him because I assumed he knew about the NSFW account. You know, because they’re monogamous? And posting your naked body regularly on Reddit is typically something you tell your monogamous boyfriend. 

&gt;	Why did I feel the need to apologize to him and not her?

You just didn’t read the damn post. I tried apologizing to her. I called her. She didn’t answer. So I texted her instead. 

I just decided that IN ADDITION, I was going to apologize to him. Because I disrespected their relationship. 

&gt;	Why didn’t you rat her out a year ago if you were so concerned about her cheating?

Because you numb-nuts; I DIDNT KNOW THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE NSFW ACCOUNT. Why would I think she’s hiding a NSFW porn account from her boyfriend? That’s CLEARLY something you tell your SO. Jesus fucking Christ. 

I didn’t want to break them up. I wanted to apologize because I was told by 300 people that I’m a piece of shit. I tried, and I just made it worst. 

But it WASNT malicious. Period. And at the end of the day, she was (either by omission or explicitly) lying to him about this account. That’s not okay in a monogamous relationship, and she deserved to be called out. 

&gt;	You did this because you were mad of her reaction to you finding her nudes. 

I didn’t but if you want to tell yourself that, you can. 

**TL;DR I’ve been jacking off to my friend’s NSFW account for over a year. I let it slipped up that I did. She was pissed at me, so I came to Reddit to see if I was being unreasonable. I was called a huge POS and felt bad. So I decided to apologize to her boyfriend (in addition to her) for disrespecting their relationship. Turns out, boyfriend had no idea this account existed.**",tifu,"TIFU by apologizing to my friend for secretly jerking off to her nude pictures, subsequently destroying her relationship with her boyfriend and obliterating our friendship."
oak_tree7,bzuxt8,"This happened when I (20F) was a sophomore in high school. A guy I was friends with but hadn't talked to in a while texted me to meet and catch up. I agreed and we got coffee. He was into making music and spent most of the time talking himself up, sounding pretty pretentious. He drove us there and on the way back to my house afterwards he wanted to stop at his house to grab something. While he was inside, I pulled out my phone to text my friend about my annoyance towards this meetup. It was something along the lines of ""He's so annoying, I can't wait to go home."" After I sit send, I suddenly hear his phone vibrate, which is still in the car with me. I look back at my phone and see his name at the top of the screen. I accidentally sent this text to him, while waiting in his car. At this point I started to panic. I lived roughly a 15 minute walk away, so I was debating whether I should just make a run for it. But, that would entail him coming back to the car, seeing me running away down the street, and seeing what I had texted him. So I did probably the smoothest and most quick thinking cover up I have done in my life.

When he got back in the car, I had a very concerned look on my face and told him apologetically that I had accidentally sent him a very personal text that I had meant to send to my mom. He gave me his phone and let me delete the text, without seeming to suspect anything. The rest of the drive home was basically me having a party in my mind for getting myself out of that super awkward situation. When thinking about this scenario to this day I still feel the panic I felt in his car, except now I can laugh about it.

I tell him to say hey and he doesn't, he pussyfoots around it and then just goes to sleep.  


This brings us to Tuesday which is largely uneventful other then him posting a couple banger memes.  


Now its Wednesday and he says he wants to try again so I tell him to say Hi and ask how her day was except he doesn't and he feeds us the same excuses and randomly goes on and offline. So I tell him look dude you either need to message her or you need talk to her at school cause without you doing either of these its not going to go anywhere. He pops online for 20 seconds reads it goes back offline.  


This takes us to Thursday so yesterday for me but today for most of you. I do a bit of thinking about what we could do and come up with an utterly horrible idea. I could be him.

Now this causes everyone to go into damage control, I was promptly kicked from the group chat and blocked by the girl he likes. 

Now my phone had died not 20 seconds before all this happens so I have no clue what happens until I arrive home at which point I see the shitstorm that has unfolded from my friend screenshotting messages and showing me and from getting messages from her friends and even death threats from of her male friends (dont worry I am safe I go to a different school 100's of km away) now at this point I realise what Ive done and how incredibly stupid it was.

LesionIsMyDaddy,c2sue6,"This literally happened about 15 minutes ago and I’m struggling to articulate actual words. Please help. Also sorry for the length but I’m trying to keep it as short as possible.

So for context, we’ll go back about 3 years. My father and I owned separate beard trimmers, but made by the same brand. They were even the same model, except my dad had a lithium battery in his. The hand-pieces are easy to tell apart, but the only physical differences of the detachable heads is that mine had a small brass plate where my dad’s was silver. More importantly, not something he would notice. One day I need to trim my facial hair but my battery’s dead, so I ask to borrow his hand-piece because I didn’t have time to recharge mine. He insists I just take his, as it’s better and he barely uses it. I eagerly accept, and put his old head and my old hand-piece on the side of my bathroom shelf I never use because I didn’t want to throw it out and DEFINITELY wouldn’t use it. I’m a tad germaphobic and sharing anything with my dad grosses me out.

Fast forward to the present day. It’s normal for me to manscape every now and then for both my girlfriend and I. As I’m too scared to take a razor down there, I’ve never actually shaved and just used my trimmer to keep things neat. Personally, I don’t see a problem with using the same mechanism on my face or pubes because, well, it’s only me. Occasionally, when my dad’s in the bathroom I’ll hear what sounds like a trimmer but have always dismissed. He gave it to me because he didn’t use it, so surely he’d be using his smaller nose hair trimmer or using his electric toothbrush?

NOW; today I heard that sound again, and as I manscaped yesterday the sound is pretty fresh in my memory. I can’t even ignore the thoughts, so, I confront him about it. He says he had started using it, but with a different head. I sceptically accept his explanation, but after checking the shaver (which I always remove the head from and clean) I find MY head connected and coated in fresh stubble. 

I asked him again about it, and he admitted he doesn’t care which head he uses, as ‘it’s not like {he’s} running it through {his} pubes’. Little does he fucking know.

2nd Background : this story happened like 4 years ago. On my city, there was a month when 2 kids near my age got suicide because of reasons. I knew them, not well but yeah I knew them.
This is important :
Number 1: he jumped from a balcony on the 3rd floor, at university's.
Number 2: This guy decide to jump from a bridge, directly to a highway. The bridge is like 100 meters from the ground. 
This last guy, people said that after reaching the ground, a car ran over him. 
I have never confirmed it... Until...

Story: 

There's me (21 M) helping my best friend - let's call him Leo (21M). Well, Leo needed some help during a furniture exposition, a well known exposition in our country. My job was basically receive the visitors in his exposition, chatting for a while, convince them about our products and then pass them to Leo so he could close some business. It was his company, so he is the boss.

There's one day, that f******* day.
A couple gets in, and I introduce myself. Then, a chat with A (M) and B (F), both in their late 30s. All is going awesome, they are liking all the stuff and at this point Leo is already with us. 
While chatting, some random people get in our expo and I say ""sorry, I have to let you... I get back asap"".
After 3/4 minutes I rejoined them. 
I swear to god, when I lefted them the chat was nice and smooth. 
But...when a joined them, their faces looked a little bit sad.
After a few seconds I realised that they're commenting the suicide number 2.
At this point, I'm still quite, watching all that... Like a cat before doing stupid things. I'm Stealth, just breathing.

My brain was like ""404 not found"", and my mouth just expelled this :

""Yah, I heard that story. People say that a car ran over him. Imagine how destroyed he got, like minced meat""

After that intelligent speech, those wise words, Leo, A and B and looking at me. Open eyes. Speechless.

At this moment I realized and thought ""oh shit, I did It again, but ok I have to move on"". And, when I think that it can't get any worst, 

Leo says : A is the guy that ran over him. 

B is looking at the ground.

A is almost crying. 

I wish I had the cloak of invisibility. 

I said ""sorry"" and get out of the room. I was really embarrassed and was afraid if B was going to have nightmares because of me. I felt like the worst person in the world.


TL;DR : joked about a suicide of a known of mine, in front of the guy who ran over him",tifu,TIFU by knowing no limits
thrill_house44,bzj0va,"Actually happened last night. Wife and I enjoy sex outdoors whenever we have the opportunity, which usually ends up being on vacations. Late at night we went to a private outdoor patio space at the Airbnb we are staying. Quite secluded and private, very unlikely that we would be seen. Finish our business and go to bed. Well today we were out there and I noticed the camera facing directly where we did the deed. And like, 6 feet away. We weren’t exactly tame either. My wife is mortified. It’s definitely a modern WiFi enabled smart camera type thing so it’s possible that, where ever the hosts are, they’ve seen it already. It’s also possible they wont bother combing through hours of footage to see that either. We will likely never know.

strongwoman214,bzggkr,"Obligatory this was a few days ago.

*But the fallout continues.*

It was 5 a.m. My training partner and I were at the gym, prepping for our next Strongman contest. You know, the lift-heavy-things kind of athletic venture. 

We cardio in fun ways. Walk ... *while carrying heavy stuff*. Push *heavy stuff*. Pull *heavy stuff*. Life *heavy stuff* fast. Load *heavy stuff* over bars. 

Until ... *it* happened.

We were doing some banded squats, minding our own business. When out of the corner of my eye, I saw something run toward me. It was small, but ***it was fast.*** 

When I realized it was a spider (*one of the angry, jumpy, runny kinds*), I screamed like a little girl (*... I am a girl, just not little*). Not only was this a spider, it was a **SPIDER**. 

It stood so tall there was sizeable space between its body and the ground. It stopped, stared and judged the jump I made onto the bench. I was quickly followed by my training partner, who apparently has springs in her legs that she never told me about.

After a series of strategic moves, we managed to corral a 35 lb. kettlebell to defend ourselves with. I tossed it. It hit the spider - *and it bounced*. The spider kept going. This happened no less than four times before we called for a back-up 25 lb. plate. 

And with that ... we broke at least one of his legs. 

Through our powers combined, we managed one final fatal kettlebell toss. Then we collapsed on the benches out of breath - because we don't cardio like that spider.

Really, that spider encounter would've been enough for me to go on for the next few years at least. My adrenaline would've spiked each time I told the story. The spider would've gotten at least 1 percent larger. My weapons would've gotten grander. I would've jumped higher.

***But it doesn't end there.***

On our way out the door ... there was a wasp. Waiting.

I *can't* with spiders. **I** ***REALLY*** **can't with bees.**

Shuffled my way out the door only to be met with MORE bees. A nest above the doorway that I swear wasn't there when I entered. 

~~I vowed to valiantly knock it down with my bare hands and stomp them until they were dead.~~ 

~~I declared to take vengeance on the winged stinging creatures with gasoline and fire.~~ 

I told my partner I'd ask my husband to hit the nest with some bee spray that night and I'd bring my spider spray with me the next day to take care of the building perimeter. 

I got in my car and drove home. Upon entering the house, my husband informs me that there's a large wasp nest in the carport. I asked him to take care of that and the nest at the gym, but he only had time to spray the home nest and gave me the can of death to take with me to the gym the next morning.

*WTF nature.*

The rest of my day was really uneventful. No angry ants. No creepy crawlers. 

But ... this morning. Right in the middle of incline bench presses, I hear it. My partner says, ""IT'S THE SAME DAMN SPIDER.""

... and maybe it was. Reincarnated as a much larger (*but ironically - or not? - slower*) spider in the exact spot of our first encounter.

***I was prepared.*** 

I ~~unholstered~~ took my can of spider spray out of a plastic grocery bag and handed it over to her. She sprayed the spider from a distance ... and he took it like a champ. Multiple hits. It took him a good 10 minutes to die. A good 10 minutes of my incline bench time. 

I checked to make sure he was dead multiple times throughout the rest of my session and soaked the inside perimeter of the gym with spider poison before we went outside.

Because I REALLY can't with bees, my partner sprayed the nest outside the door. Nest number two was already under construction so she gave it some sprays as well. I started around the outside perimeter of the building with the spider spray, but only made it along one wall. The grass was too high - ***you don't know what's in there***.

It's over, I thought. The aerosols of death have been deployed ... there shall be no more.

Fast-forward to around 1 p.m. today. 

I'm in my office. Jamming to some music. Heard a fly on my window, which is odd. Seventh floor. Double-paned, painted-shut windows. 

***IT WAS A FUCKING WASP.***

... now that I've gathered myself from having to ask a co-worker to come take care of this **MAJOR HUGE SUPER IMPORTANT LIFE OR DEATH** issue in my office ... I have resigned myself to the fact that TIFU by killing that cardio spider and now nature is trying to kill me.

TL;DR - Killed a spider at the gym, now being attacked by spiders and bees everywhere. It was great knowing you, Reddit.",tifu,TIFU by killing a cardio spider
eclipse798,bzne7r,"After months of lurking on this sub, I unfortunately have a reason to post. This happened yesterday, and my girlfriend asked me if she could look through my phone. Knowing I had nothing to hide, I complied. She found a DM of my friend and I, who I had met online and had no attraction or feelings towards, just another gaming buddy. 

Last year, she came out to me as transgender, male to female. I would treat her as I was talking to another one of my real life male friends, fucking around and had DM’d her in a conversation saying: ‘damb [person] looking sexy 😍’ and ‘nice song choice bub 😍’. (These comments occurred a couple months ago, and I had forgotten that I had even said those disgusting things) She had also posted comments on my Instagram photos that crossed the line, such as ‘daddy 😩’. My responses ultimately enabled her, since I replied with things like ‘thanks 👀’. 

Thats how she spoke to me sometimes and conversation was normal. It never went to the extent of discussing feelings, because there simply wasn’t any between us because she was only just somebody on the internet. I had only commented those two things, while she had used emojis (😍😩💕). 

If I had saved the conversations, I would write them down in better detail but I have removed this person and am unable to get the messages. That’s how I had fucked up. There was an instance where my girlfriend had told me that she was uncomfortable with my friend’s instagram comment and that I have to tell her not to comment things like that again. 

I didn’t think it would persist, and since I knew she wasn’t trying to make any advancements (I recall her saying that she wasn’t interested in males?), I didn’t say anything. She had left a comment recently (aforementioned ‘daddy’, with my response.) and my girlfriend told me it was borderline cheating and that she lost trust in me. I was disgusted with myself that I didn’t put a stop to it earlier and enabled her to say those over the line comments. 

My girlfriend seeing those DM’s yesterday, destroyed her. She immediately broke up with me. After all of those times that I told her that If I ever cheated, I would kill myself. My disgusting actions led to my relationship being ruined. She was perfect, and if I had never said those things we’d still be together right now. I had tried to tell her that I had treated my online friend as another one of my male friends with such comments, but that got me nowhere. 

She now wants nothing to do with me, and that she wants me out of her life. I want to make it up to her one day so she can forgive me, and at least become friends again, but there’s no chance in hell right now. What I have done will forever stick with me. I will regret it for the rest of my life. She was my everything. I can’t believe I didn’t realise and stop myself before writing such responses to the ‘friend’. I never hid these things from my girlfriend because I thought it was ok. It clearly wasn’t. 

I want to make things better so badly, but only time can fix it now. I don’t want to live with myself knowing that I did such fowl thing. Don’t be like me. 

TL;DR 

I had a transgender (male to female) friend who I had met online. She had told me that she transitioned, I had respected her decision yet kept on talking to her like she was my male friend. Since I talk to my male friends in a joking kind of way (damn dad, have my children 😍, looking sexy 👀...), I had spoke to her the same way without realising how bad it seemed. Girlfriend intervened when internet friend started Instagram comments in posts, I said I’d tell internet friend to stop, I didn’t, assuming that internet friend wouldn’t persist. Girlfriend looks through DM’s, sees comments I had made, and broke up with me. I definitely deserve this, and I don’t know how I can go on.

Edit: regarding those suicidal comments, I had walked off when it had happen. The ambulance was called on me, and I was prevented from doing anything. I still have those thoughts and the regret will stay for a long time. However I am in a somewhat better state. I just have to focus on moving on.

Edit 2: to clarify and add additional context, we are both 16 with strong morals regarding cheating. I apologise the age was not provided earlier, and if the writing is all over the place.

GrapeGunner,c3ae6i,"I'm posting this on moblie on the way to work, sorry for the formatting. 

This happened about a year ago. I was a sophmore and for a while had been messing around with a friend with benifits of mine. She was a senior and I had AP Psych with her. 

So one day, because we sat next to eachother in class I had the brilliant idea to put my hands down her pants and go to town. Our class was arranged so that the tables sat two people and were spread across the room, we were in the farthest back table in the room. 

So I started going at it for a bit and after about 5 minutes she told me to slow down a bit. She always had been loud when she came, but my stupid ass didn't think about that at the time. So I kept going until she grabbed my hand and told me to stop because she didn't want to make a scene. 

I thought it would be a bit fun to get her to cum in class, and knew she was into it, as we had done stuff like this before. 

So I kept going, lo and behold she came, loudly, in the middle of class. 

We both got called out of class and I got a 3 day in school suspension.

I had my backpack and shoes and was ready to go when I saw a little boy chasing a piece of paper. He soon gave up after a bit and my sister said to go get it. I ran 150m before I got it and jogged back to the father.(who was with his son)
""You probably won't need this, but here you go."" I said a little out of breath. 
He just said thank you and then we left. An hour or two later I realized and checked my car and my bag before realizing what probably happened. I went back to the same beach and checked the same path and surrounding areas before giving up.

Obligatory this didn’t happen today, a few years ago. Alright so every time someone asks me what the largest money-related fuck up I’ve ever made is, this I the story I tell. Apologies for being on mobile, etc. 

I want to start this with a brief disclaimer: When I was 14/15 I had just gotten my first iPhone, and back then to set it up Apple required you to have a debit or credit card on the account. My mom let me put hers on, but used restrictions to turn off the ability for in app purchases. I figured out the password for the restrictions and turned the ability back on. 
I was obsessed with playing Kim Kardashian Hollywood, and I would regularly purchase the $4.99 packs of K stars to buy more premium things. 
Now you might wonder how my mom didn’t notice, well I was having all the emails sent to my email account. 
So this was going on for at least a month, I honestly can’t really remember the timeline. All I remember is my mom calling me on her way home from work and warning me that we were gonna have a talk. 

All in all, I had spent $700 of my moms money on Kim Kardashian. Apple refunded all of it once she explained that, oh no, she didn’t make those charges.

Go downstairs.  Second fight breaks out.  She says I am on my phone too much when I spend time with our young son.  True I was playing a game, but it wasn't the intense kind that you have to pay attention to.  Just hit a button every few minutes.  I argue this point and she is having none of it.

Says I need to put my phone down for 30 minutes when I'm with him.  I get angry, I work 60 hours a week, don't I get some time?  She reminds me that I stay up late and am playing games for 3 hours a night.  Not that it matters, baby is asleep by the time I get home.  I go into a rage BUT I DON'T BREAK ANYTHING EXPENSIVE, which is what I generally do.  I control myself enough to make it downstairs.  I smash a walking crutch against the stone wall, breaking it.

She chases after me once she hears something break.  It is established that she is not to come into the basement after we have fought, because bad things happen.  She blames my anger on the fact that I took my pills (Lithium and some other one) late a few times the previous week.  Not that I missed taking them, but I was a few hours late.

I am taken against my will to the local hospital and am kept in the ER overnight.  The wife and I keep in contact throughout the night.  I am very upset that she followed me into the basement.  I am very upset that she had me taken away to the hospital.

So here it is,

So remember in the previous story how the girl in my class (let's call her S) kissed her best friend's bf? Well, after I posted part 1, her best friend (B) dm'ed me again, asking what kind of stuff S had said about her. I told her a few things, some of which had nothing to do with B. 

Today I saw S again in class, I only had a few hours of school today so I didn't have to talk to her much. But apparently, she hadn't told the teacher, which really surprised me, but since the teacher didn't know about anything and I didn't wanna tell him, he had me and S work together.  

You'd expect that to be awkward/suck horribly. And your expectations aren't wrong. It actually DID suck and it was pretty annoying. She was just mad the whole time and kept saying stuff like ""You shouldn't even be smiling, you're the cause of this (the argument between S and B)"" 

And I ofcourse told almost the whole class what had happened, so they all knew about it and were on my side. But there was one friend who was really annoyed with S (L). Since L was sitting at the table next to us, she could hear anything we said and we could hear anything she said. So me and L just started talking like S wasn't even with us.

And since L was mad at S, she just started talking about how annoying S is while she was just sitting next to us and hearing everything and just saying like ""Ah thanks"" sometimes.

Cornedcrime,c6eh0o,"I recently had a traumatic encounter with a baby pig that put me right off meat. You don't fully know what goes into slaughtering an animal until you experience it first hand. I wrote about my encounter in my comments history if anyone cares to read it to get why I was traumatised.
I decided to go to a local Vegan Festival.

 I went to the vegan festival last week to sample the goods and there was at least 30 people. Three of the vendors had very matted hair and dirty nails. I was starving so I asked ""No bull bill"" to fire up a few beetroot patties for me. He toasted that bun to perfection, slipped in the patty, doused it with vegan ketchup and god, I never tasted anything like it in my life.

I threw up all over the woman sitting next to me and then hurled puke all over a newborn baby in its buggy. It tasted like feet, paper and sour tomato. I spewed chunks of the burger I just ingested and that morning coco puffs all over that lady and the little baby just dozing away. I guess it was a disgusting sight. Blood red chunks mixed with soulless puff rice pieces. It was like plasma that ejected from the mystery machines ghost trapper.

I recieved a frosty reception off the woman sitting beside me and I was nearly punched by the baby's dad. I apologised to them and told them that I have a really weak stomach and the food tasted disgusting. I just projectiled instantly. No bull Bill was livid. He bashed his fist down onto a counter of onions and screamed at me to ""leave"". Those vegan people ganged up on me like a band of wild monkeys. They were closing in on me.

I upped and left feeling extremely dejected. I thought those hippies were good people, believed in free love, and tolerance. I was wrong. I was nearly beaten to death for not keeping my good in my stomach. Usually I don't vomit but my stomach rejected the taste straight away. The strong odour from the burger eminated from my gut up into my nostrils. It was like rubbing fungal feet into stomach acid.

As traumatising as the experience was seeing the little piggy die, the trauma from the vegan festival was worse. I am an older gentleman and I really wanted my mom. :(

i sit down and as i’m waiting for my drink i pull out my phone. i see that he went through my favorites folder, which is filled with my nudes... my heart literally sank to the floor and as i looked up i saw him looking at me and when we made eye contact he smiled at me. my desperation to leave has never been higher before.

my name FINALLY gets called up for my drink and he hands it to me. as he is handing it to me he holds onto it so our hands touch, meanwhile i’m trying to leave as fast as i can to avoid the embarrassment. he looks at me and says “you’re very beautiful, please come again soon.” while smiling at me. i felt my face get very hot so i knew i was blushing, i took my drink and mumbled a quick ‘thank you’. 

after i got my drink i walked out of there as fast as i could...

TL;DR : cashier tries to scan the barcode on my phone at starbucks, he can’t scan it so i give him my phone to type in the code. he saw my nudes that were in the same album as the barcode",tifu,TIFU by giving the cashier my phone

i couldn't move my head to see the spider, but i could feel from the vibration of the web that it was getting closer, and i could also see bipedal creature coming closer from the corner of my eye. i knew i would die very soon from one or the other. but then big hand comes and yanks the spider from spider web! the web got a little looser. it looked at me ugly but it didn't want to grab me. it just ate the spider instead. wow. it let out a yell and went away. it ate the spider to save me. i didn't know it was capable of showing altruism. eventually i got free from the last of the spider web, and i am now safe. i was very lucky to get away from the web thanks to it.

I wasn't sure what was going to fulfill my craving until I saw the golden arches. I was going to get myself something from McDonald's. As I turned into the parking lot and drove into the drive thru line, I knew a tough decision was ahead of me. Did I want a smoothie? Or did I want a McFlurry? But if I got the McFlurry, what topping should I get? No, I should just settle for an apple pie. As I was becoming increasingly more indecisive, the line moved and it was my turn. Oh man, I had to make a quick decision. So i decided to settle for a plain sundae. I pull up to the menu, the lady asks "" can i take your order"" and I confidently state that I would like a plain vanilla sundae. What she says next rocked my world.

FoknUrEx,c0nhe5,"(This happened last night in a 420 legal state so no laws were broken in the making this TIFU)

Last night was a nightmare nothing less than a horror movie. Talk about bad trips, this was one of them. And indeed the worst one I've had lately. I live in a shared apartment and since both my flatmates are on vacation I am pretty much alone at home. My office is far from home and my job is frustrating. I regularly smoke pot at night to take the edge off. 

Last night was turning out to be a routine night. Had just got done with a tiring day. And what's better than taking a bong hit and vibing to some rap music? 

I ordered food online, crushed some weed, grabbed my bong and filled up the bowl. Sparked the lighter and took 2 wiz khalifa tokes back to back.

Within seconds I was high and out. I struggled a bit, coughed a couple of times but damn that hit me hard. I knew that I'd taken too much. Way too much. Way above my tolerance actually. ""But who cares? Fuck everything!"" that's what I thought initially. I didn't care much. I was half naked listening to my smoke sesh playlist on YT on my laptop and scrolling menes on Instagram on my phone. I was waiting for my dinner to arrive.

Soon, I started talking to myself and laughing for no reason. After like 5 minutes or so I remember getting up abruptly from my bed and walking fast to the bathroom mirror (Don't know why). I observed my eyes. They were blood red! I started losing my balance! My heart was pounding as if I had run a marathon. There was a weird feeling in my mind that I'm gonna get a heart attack and die.  Now, I was having a heart burn. And I was shit-scared.

I started feeling thirsty so I reached for my water bottle. I was having trouble swallowing water! It was feeling as though my oesophagus had swollen. But my mouth was dry. The fatigue and dizziness was so bad that I could barely help myself to type on my laptop. I went on Quora and typed 'I smoked too much weed am I gonna die?'. There I came across answers which literally made me shit my pants. Try putting yourself in my shoes. A guy literally wrote ""You're feeling like this cause you're actually dying!"". This made me even more paranoid. I actually threw an empty beer bottle out of my window and heard it shatter.

Now, I was having a full fledged panic attack! I started walking in circles and I kept saying to myself ""I'm never doing this shit again, I made a mistake. I'm a dickhead!""

I was feeling more thirsty at the same time I was having hydrophobia. I thought I'd die of dehydration or some sort of organ failure. Being sober now, I laugh at my naiveness. But at that moment it was a complete different scenario. I was over thinking way too much. So I called up a freind who lived nearby (in case I die someone would know). I don't remember what I spoke but it was gibberish and stupid. I cut the call abruptly. Now, I started retrospecting, the way I grew up, the past, my mom, my friends. It felt so real. I even started hearing my Dad speak (He passed away 2 years back). I heard knocking on my door but was too afraid to open it. Suddenly,the lights went out cause there was a power-cut. I was sweating, panting for breath now. I coud feel my heart racing, my chest paining, my mouth dry and my brain overflowing with so many thoughts. I  Googled ways of getting sober but was too fucked up to do anything. I couldn't bare it. I went in my balcony semi-nude and decided to jump 14 stories down. In order to stop the torture. Trust me it wasn't one of those regular bad trips. I had gone insane. I felt someone sneaking up on me from behind and try to push me down. Luckily, the doorbell rang. I opened the door, my dinner had arrived (A good 45 minutes late) Phew! I paid the dude and diverted my mind to eating. I hogged like a hungry hound. Now I started feeling a little normal. I then realized how late my dinner had arrived I understood that the knocks i heard was the delivery guy.

Anyway, after eating I decided to jerk-off to keep my mind away from the anxiety. I jerked off twice (it felt so good). I checked the time, 2 hours had passed since i started trippin'. I was nearing soberness now. I made myself coffee and again went to the balcony. It was drizzling, the weather was beautiful it was almost 1 am and I felt like it was early morning. 

Sipping my hot coffee I said to myself, ""I think I've reached my high"" and I decided to take a break from smoking marijuana. And stop smoking it alone altogether.


TL;DR

Was home alone,smoked excess weed. Had a terrible BT ( panic attack) followed by a food-gasm followed by two beautiful orgasms and a hot cup of Java. Decided to stop smoking up for a while.

perfumetifuthrowaway,bz1upp,"First, just a short background to try to defend myself. It’s kind of an embarrassing to say, but my older sister is one of those stereotypical MLM huns (my sister is honest to God relentless, she is like fucking Thanos except instead of destroying the world, she just wants you to buy LuLaRoe or optavia or whatever the fuck it is, every day I wish she would apply that focus to something else). She bounces from one “business” to the other and is currently selling (or trying to sell) doTERRA. She’s hounded my parents and me and any family friends willing to listen to her. My mom always buys whatever it is to try to support her and so do some of my mom’s friends, who get trapped sometimes when they visit and end up buying just to end the awkwardness. She’s gone after my friends and coworkers before on FB before I unfriended her. Needless to say it’s kind of a high tension issue in my family. I tend to get irrationally annoyed just even at the sight of a Mary Kay bottle or a Lipsense tube, and I definitely avoid the topics of MLMs and don’t tell anyone about my sister.



I’ve been going out with my girlfriend for 2 years now. I basically never let her meet my sister and only brought her to my parents’ house when I know my sister isn’t there. My girlfriend likes makeup a lot and purchases new things frequently. I always pay a lot of attention to her makeup, to the point where she’s made comments about how she hasn’t had a boyfriend who’s that interested before. Like I would ask to see her lipstick when she’s putting it on after lunch or look at her eyeshadow palette when she’s doing her makeup. I feel kind of bad here because I think she’s genuinely excited that I’m interested but I’m really just checking to make sure they are not MLM brands. Her stuff usually have really fancy packaging and are from pretty expensive brands so I just assumed she’d be safe from MLMs if she ever meets a hun, just because they wouldn’t be up to her standards.



We moved in together two week ago and I got the shock of my life when I saw a whole army of those little 5ml amber bottles with amateur looking packaging all over her dresser. I asked her what they were and she said perfume oils and I know this sound dramatic, but I felt myself dying inside envisioning us married and her shilling “magic” oils to our friends. I tried to joke and said I thought she’d be the type to use Chanel perfumes and she just laughed and said something about how the mainstream brands don’t have the scents she want.



Here is where I should’ve been smart and rational and talked to her like a normal human being about MLMs and my family history with them and about how I don’t want her to use them, and then she would have had a chance to let me know that she bought those from actual independent perfume stores, who happened to sell their stuff in similar looking bottles. Or I could’ve even been my usual sneaky self and just checked her bottles and googled the brands. Instead I got weird and withdrawn for a whole week, right after moving in together, and then when I saw a stray bottle on the bathroom counter, threw it into the trash.



It turned out to be a discontinued scent and one of her favorites. When she asked me later if I have seen it, I told her what I did and it basically blew up into a huge fight where she thought I was regretting moving in together or having issues sharing space until I told her what’s going on. She then dragged me to her dresser and basically listed out each brand and made me go to each website so I could see that they are indeed, independent small businesses making perfume oils and have nothing to do with MLMs. We’ve made up now but I think I may have done some real damage to our relationship. She’s told me that she’s aware of MLMs and that she wouldn’t ever buy from them. Today she even showed me the new lipsticks she bought, but she just seemed sad now that she knows I was just checking to see if her makeups were MLMs. I apologized to her and told her that I trust her 100% and she didn’t need to show me if she didn’t want to but everything is just awkward now. I feel bad I threw out her favorite perfume and tried asking her what the name was, since I didn’t even look at it before I threw it out, but she just told me not to bother because it’s discontinued and I wouldn’t be able to find it for sale. I honestly feel so bad about all this and wish I could’ve just told her what was happening from the very beginning, now I feel like I just damaged my most important relationship with one of the best people in the world.



TL;DR: I fucked up my relationship by thinking my SO was using MLM essential oils without asking her and throwing away her favorite perfume from a legitimate brand. If any of you out there are shilling whatever MLM it is that you are shilling, please re-evaluate what you are doing.",tifu,TIFU by throwing away my SO's favorite perfume thinking it was a BS essential oil from an MLM

Wikipedia told me that the name for a tame, pet rat is 'fancy rat'.

We got three males. They're young still and their... Manparts are just enormous. Like, we started wondering if that was normal, or some medical condition.

So I type into Google:

I struggle to remember a day that went by where she didnt eat at least SOME pineapple. It's not the biggest deal though because it doesn't stop her from living her life, and she is otherwise an incredibly enjoyable person to be around. 

Anyways, the actual fuck up happened two days ago when I came home from work. I was famished, and in a big rush because I had a lot to get done. We didn't have much in the fridge at the time, so I quickly ate some of the pineapple that was in a can. I didn't think much of it because she already had four other cans in the pantry, I thought there was no possibility of her noticing. As it turns out though, she did notice because later that evening she stormed into the room and asked pretty angrily, ""did you eat some of my fucking pineapple?"" 
I was admittedly caught off guard by her tonality, so I lied without really thinking and said I didnt. She stared at me for what felt like hours but evevntually went back to the kitchen. At this point I couldn't tell if she believed me or not, so I just assumed that she did. 

Well, things carried on as usual from that point up until last night.  We were having sex and as I was reaching the point of no return, she suddenly blurts out, ""you know- if you ate my pineapple I'll be able to tell from the taste of your cum.""

GoodLikeCheese,c01yo6,"I work in nice restaurant in the northern half of the US. I realized I have a developed a pretty strong crush on one of my coworkers. Very subtle for about 6 months. No big deal. But we have become more casual in our friendship as we have very many over lapping interests and our humor syncs up. We text a good deal. Nothing intense. Just funny stuff or things we like or work. And holy moley (&lt;—- not my usual catchphrase, just don’t want to get recognized on this throwaway lol) is she just gorgeous.

Sounds good right? 2 problems.

First, I am actually one of her supervisors in the restaurant. So that position gives me an uneasiness. Like if I make a mistake, I can lose my job. Or I don’t want to come off as a creepy boss. But in my defense we are in the same age group around 29 by a couple of years (not like 50 yr old chasing a teenager kind of thing). Or less serious than that, because I’m her “boss” she will just not consider me for anything outside of work. As in, if we didn’t work together, we would probably do all kinds of stuff and be friends, but because of our jobs, it just can’t now because I may just be seen as her supervisor in her eyes.

But even if I overcame that the second larger issue is that she has a boyfriend of 2 years or so. Now I am not one to wreck an entire relationship for selfish reasons. Yes a part of me wishes that certain things would change, but the grown up part of me says to not think like that. They seem like they are in a healthy relationship so I don’t want to be a jerk and wreck it.


So now I am trying figure out not how to get into a relationship with her, but rather how do I no longer care?

Right so just a few hours ago, me (F/25) and my S/O (M/26) went drinking with one of his best mates at her house. She lives only a few blocks from our house and it was totally cool...we managed to get home on foot and make it home safe and semi sober.

Fast forward to bed time. I was feeling a little frisky because i'm a little horndog and the buzz was making me want it real bad so I started sucking on his nipples to turn him on. It worked because I felt him getting hard and from there I started to give him the old beej. When I got him all stiff and ready for action, I told him to come down to our shag rug (we have a space at the bottom of the bed for sexy time).

He goes and rolls of the bed in a thunk. This should have been my indicator number one that all systems shouldn't go AT ALL. But then I thought he was just being his ol' goof ball self so didn't think nothing of it.

Proceeded to climb on top of him and ride like the cowgirl I was. His mouth was open the entire time and he was moaning. At some point I was wondering if I was already in rapeville so I checked on him to make sure he was awake. His heads snaps back up and he tells me he's awake.

Fast forward to us switching with him on top. This is where the real fuck up begins.  When he gets into screwing position, he crashes on top of me. 

Now, i'm only 5'6"" weighing about 154 lbs. and he's 6'4"" weighing around 180 - 190 lbs. so imagine my panic when I start to hear him snoring.

I was naked. On the floor.  With a huge man on top of me...and his weight was crushing my chest and stomach.

So I start nudging and shaking him awake. Again, his head snaps back up and he starts looking around wildly. He looks at me lying under him and he goes...""What. What's going on?""  He keeps looking around figuring out what happened.

""Uhhh.. we were having...sex?"" I gasp..words barely escaping my mouth as I felt him still crushing me.

He slurs. ""Really??"" he looks at me, prolly turning blue under him.

""Yes...now...can you...get off me.  Can't- breathe-""

""Ooop Sorry."" He flails and manages to get off of me.

At this point I should have just gotten dressed and helped him get dressed...but nooo.

I managed tonget him hard enough again to stick it in me.  As we got into position again, he fricken plops again on top off me.  He starts slurring/yelling out: ""Elp meeeee~~ Eeelp meeeeee~"" 

Call it adrenaline rush but I managed to get him off of me and he ragdolls at the side, still chanting ""Eeeeelp me~~""

IDK how we did it but he managed to still cum...

He gets off me and sits in front of me as I cleaned myself up.  When I finished, his mouth was hanging open as he snored. He was butt naked on the floor, asleep.

...I had to help him get dressed and put him back on the bed and shit. Helping him up was a bitch.  I ended up busting my lip because he threw his head back as I attempted to help him stand from behind. Minutes after putting him back, he rolls off the bed and I had to rinse repeat, help him stand up, put him back to the bed and tuck him to sleep. He probably won't remember what happened.

I've been with my bf for four years now, from the start he's been firm on not having children so i thought it would be fun to prank him. The idea came from my friend who is pregnant. I went as far as asking her to take another pregnancy test so i could take it to him later that day. That was earlier this morning.  

Before i told him i was building the case, looking anxious, being on the phone talking with an upset tone (the pregnant friend) etc. So when I told him it didn't take long before he bought it. He asked repeatedly me if i was joking, if i was sure, freaked out and was now standing up. Asked me how long it's been, how it happened etc. but after a while he calmed down annd said he need to be alone for a while so he went out. This was a succeess i thought.

An hour or so later the bf was back, this time with a complete different approach, he only asked about me and the baby, how i want to handle it, if we should move in together and then he dropped the fucking bomb.

So there were a few people in line so I whip out my phone for music and start listening to Spotify. So I reached the front of the queue and no taxies appeared and then I noticed a button for getting a taxi. I pressed it once, nothing happened. So I pressed it 3 times but continued out of habit without realizing what I was doing. 2 minutes later no taxies...Ah shit. I whipped around and went to the ice-cream kiosk 3 meters away and got a hot fudge Sunday. Whilst I was enjoying my ice-cream I noticed 15 taxies entering the taxi stand all stopping and beeping. Guess one taxi driver had enough and revved his engine and sped forward bashing the car in front. Then more taxis arrived and one taxi reversed back to pull out of the traffic jam but ended up hitting the driver behind. I thought to myself ""The fuck is going on""?

Then it hit me, that button... \*\*that fucking button....\*\*called over 30 taxies to arrive. I finished my ice-cream and looked around watching drivers shouting and swearing at each other and telling each other to move. Just when I thought the chaos couldn't get any worse, a car came down the ramp a bit too fast and hit another driver in front. I just finished my ice-cream and just walked away with my head down.

So I feel like I need to offer some back story for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always believed I had a small penis.  Embarrassingly small.  Back in middle school, me and my friends would talk about our sizes and amidst stories of ""I have to wrap it around my waist a bit"" and ""1 foot flaccid 2 foot erect"" I was convinced that I had a very small dick.  Aside from that, my only experiences seeing a dick was in porn and guys who walked around naked in locker rooms, to the best of my knowledge that was what the average dick size was.  I had several women tell me I had a large dick, but I figured it was just something a woman always told a guy that was 100% bullshit.  This was something I had confirmed when I had a really bad breakup with a woman I had dated for 3 years.  At the end of our relationship she told me I was the worst kind of person imaginable, a shit human being, and that I had a tiny penis.  At this point, I had all the evidence that proved I had a tiny penis, one I should be ashamed to ever reach the light of day.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Another reason I've always thought I had a small dick is because I was always made fun of that way, being Asian.  The number of times I've heard the ""egg roll"" comment....

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory done, here's what happened.  My fiancee is very kinky, and had ordered a few bedroom toys she wanted to try out.  One of the toys had two openings, a larger one that both the balls and the penis could fit through attached by a hinge joint to one that just the penis goes through.  It did a couple other things (use your imagination).  Anyway, my fiancee warns me and says something like ""I'm not sure this is usable, you might be too big for it"".  I took it as foreplay and completely ignored it as a warning.  I had a tiny dick, by what delusion could it be too big for anything?  Oh, I have an interesting tidbit I forgot to mention earlier.  After the fun times are over, my penis remains erect for a length of time.

&amp;#x200B;

We have some fun times, then afterwards everything starts to HURT.  I was stuck.  She saw I was in agony and quickly tried to remove the device, but she couldn't.  After that, she tried to turn it off (which took a little minute, because it was a newer toy.)  She turned it off, but it still felt like my dick was being chopped off.  I had too much girth so I couldn't pull out of it, and I couldn't remove the hinge part because my dick was too long.  So what followed was about 30 minutes of painful suffering until I was able to remove the device. After I was finally able to remove it, my loving fiancee chimed in with ""See?  I was right.  We can't use this.""  I was in shock (partly from the excruciating pain) and in disbelief and stammered about how I don't know how this could have happened with my small penis.  (The next time we were having sex she STOPPED DURING SEX and whipped out a tape measure, then pulled up a laptop and googled stats to prove that she was right.  Bless her heart.)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR got my dick got stuck in a sex toy because I thought my dick was too small to ever get stuck in a sex toy.

Edit:  I'm not sure how I should feel about people being skeptical of this story.  I guess I should be flattered?  Part of me feels like I'm being punked.  Either way, it's probably the most interesting thing that has happened to me all year so I wanted to share the story of how my dick got stuck in something.",tifu,TIFU by believing I had a small penis (NSFW)
myworstnightmare1,bwm999,"So ya girl is done with her first year of college and I'm back home with my parents for the summer. A high school friend of mine hit me up asking if I wanted a job. Turns out she started working at a massage parlor after graduating last year and said they could always use more girls. She told me not to worry about needing experience and that most guys are mainly concerned about getting an extra tug at the end.

I thought why not. This is a better alternative than going back to the evil golden arches where I part timed in high school. Anyways, so fast forward to tonight, I'm in the back room chilling and waiting to get a new client when a regular client (according to my boss) comes in. He asked my boss up front for his regular girl but she was busy working on another client so my boss suggested trying one of the new girls (me). He obliged and my boss put him into one of our private rooms.

My boss tells me I'm up and I go into the room. Keep in mind our rooms are pretty dimly lit for ambiance so what I saw was pretty much just another naked guy on his back, it didn't scream ""DAD!!"" to me. We exchanged pleasantries and now that I think about it, I guess it also didn't help that I gave out my 'working' name instead of my real name. So I go to work on his back before moving onto some light touching on some erogenous area. I tell him to turn over and it felt like time had stopped because the image of my dad with his hard on is now seared into my memory. There was no happy ending for my dad to say the least. I just said our session was done and walked out of the room so I'm not quite sure what happened afterwards. I'm pretty sure he recognized me cause he didn't make any fess with my boss on the way out. 

I told my boss I quit and now I'm sleeping over at my friend's place. I still have not had any communication with my parents (except to tell my mom I'm sleeping over). I don't know if I should say something first to my dad or wait for him to say something.

The first time we meet up, i go over to his cousins house where he’s staying. He turns on a playlist, dims the lights, and we start talking, drinking, and making out. Things are getting hot as fuck. Its my time to shine! It’s sweaty and humid and we don’t even care. My shirt comes off, our pants come off, we’re grinding on each other, I suck his dick, gag all over his dick, slobber everywhere, he titty fucks me, then I finish by sucking his dick again. Ooooohhhhh weeeeeeeee!!!

Once i catch my breath, I blindly feel my way to the bathroom, flip on the light, and there’s fucking blood everywhere. On my hands, on my neck, on my boobs, on my stomach. He ripped out one of my dermals with the head of his dick and we were so hot in the moment neither of us felt it. Soooo that’s why (to this day) you can’t titty fuck me.

So, when we were both upset and she sat next to me to apologize for yelling at me. And an emotional talk. Now, I typically don't like people sitting right next to me. But because I didn't quite know how to ask her to go back to her lounge chair, my autism kicks in and I pretty much decided to make up some dumb lie.

The conversation as follows;

Me: ""Uh, can you move back over there?""

Mum: ""why""

Me: ""Umm....I'm watching...porn"" (I do not look at porn)

Mum: ""I wouldn't mind watching some porn""

The subject was changed, but a little while later, she told me to follow her upstairs so she could show me something she made. I agreed and went upstairs with her. We went into her room and she shut the door behind us. She then began to get undressed in front of the door. My drunk brain said ""yes! Time to get laid"" nor even registering who it was, so I undressed too. We ended up hugging passionately. We both sobered up and we agreed that no one would ever find out, EVER. I slept on their couch that night and drove home the next morning. 

Fast forward about a week later and she messages me saying she needed to talk and to come over. I head over to their place and she is the only one home. She told me that she was pregnant. We talked about the next course of action for over an hour.

dead_stone,9psll2,"Obligatory: Throw-away account - Happened yesterday but still reeling in its effects - Long-time lurker.

Please note, English isn't my first language so grammar Nazi's out there in the wild are welcome to troll me :)

**Prologue**

I'm a journalist (the print kind) and my boyfriend is a paediatrician (child doctor kind). We have been in a relationship for a bit over 7 years and living together for the past 2 years. We are busy people. When I cover a story, I'm gone for days at a time. As for him, there are laws that strictly prohibit him from taking long hours but during emergencies or other important cases laws are often bent a bit. Despite his gruelling schedules he is always calm around children. I always feel he'd make a great father. He is kind and sensitive and all the normal laundry list of things that girls dig in a guy. Anyway, he gets real sensitive over silly issues but lets me take lead on important matters. So fights and arguments are often really around silly things like the kind of toothpaste or soap, etc.

**The meat**

Now here's the juicy part. This little story is our kind of sexually deviant behavior. Like all 20 something horny couples, we do things that is welcome in privacy, but not welcome in public. We swap food while kissing. It's common for us to suck food out of each other's mouths at dinner - the only time we normally get to spend time together and bitch about our day.

Like usual, I was gone for almost 2 weeks covering an important story and he was on and off at the hospital owing to some child's health. It was so important for him that he kept extending his schedule for a good 3 months now. So when were to meet yesterday, we made some plans - extreme plans to juice all night. He has this amazing ability to hold off his final pitch for hours. This gives us time to disco all night long if need be. There was one time when we ran our industrious labour almost all night before I collapsed. He was still standing up right like Eiffel tower.

He was well ahead of me and prepared the grounds yesterday. As soon as I came walked into the house, I saw him stark naked with his pole held up high. Ran towards me and kissed.

See, my oral hygiene isn't exactly the kind that is angelic - it isn't barbaric either. I do keep it clean. But I've been warned several times in the past to improve on it; sometimes erupting in arguments. I was a bit busy, so I hadn't brushed my teeth since Thursday. So, to hide the stench, I was chewing gum while I entered the house. I do have a little problem with tonsil stones that surfaces occasionally. Somehow chewing gum loosens it up. I was trying to pick it apart as it rolled into the gum and was not prepared for that aggressive kiss that came my way.

He swapped it. Felt the unholy stench. Moved away. I could see his flag pole curl in like a scared dog's tail between the legs. He ran inside the bedroom. By the time I cleaned myself and got ready he was dead asleep.

**Epilogue**

He got up this morning and silently left the house. It's almost night and he hasn't replied to my SMS and calls to his phone land in voice mail. I called up his hospital and the administrator office told me he's busy.

TL;DR I kissed my boyfriend and swapped my chewing gum laced with tonsil stones.

**EDIT**

* Thank you all for the comments and concerns. I spoke to him last night. Things are OK. And my mouth is back to being brilliant.

* Those of you who think that I skip brushing teeth every day, please note this is a one-off case. Journalism is a cut-throat business. I'm happy I got the sotry before any other media outlet did. It's like Reddit OC - except it's taken to extremes. People do extreme things to get the story out - missing meals or skipping on personal hygene for a short while, is the least of it. People don't become heroes, but missing deadlines could easily make me a villain in a male dominated field. Also, these kinds of stories about me wades off unwanted advances :) FYI – Unlike India where such advances are blown out of proprtions to generate awareness, here its brushed off like nothing - dangerous man.

* The chewing gum is like mouth wash liquid. There are dissolving strips too which give the same benefit. We don't need a prescription to buy it. I can post a photo of it but doing so will reveal my identity. Something I'd rather not.

* About swapping – Thankfully, this is not my primary account, so say what you want. You are the same men who would frequent PornHub and watch even more disgusting forms of Porn and don't gross out.",tifu,TIFU by kissing my bf

As well as that, I refuse to wear sunscreen at all. And I got burned all over my body. And I’m going to an amusement park tomorrow. 

Anyway, onto the friend part.


So this girl I’ve been online friends with for over a year, we’ll call her... Daisy. Okay, so me and Daisy talk all the time, and have very similar interests. She was cute and I was lonely so indubitably I have a little crush on her. 

Okay more like full blown love, but you know what I didn’t let it get in the way of our friendship. Anyway, I loved talking to her she was so cool.

But about a month ago she got a boyfriend. He was nice but I never really trusted him. Just jealousy probably but I didn’t let either of them know my disdain for him. I just let it be.

However recently I’d been feeling really bad because my feelings were growing stronger and we were drifting apart because she talked to her boyfriend ALL THE TIME. And I mean all the time. We are talking 24+ hour long calls.

So I kept my sadness to myself, until I let a little slip in a group chat. Daisy was in this chat, but she had deleted her account so she couldn’t see what we sent. Still dumb on my part.

I spilled everything. My love, and my hate for her boyfriend. Obviously she isn’t gonna see it, I mean, her account was deleted right? 

So later I went out with my family and when I got home I checked my phone and what did I see? Text from daisy. In the group chat. She saw it all.

By this point I’m freaking out and screaming running all around my house. I don’t check the chat for about an hour. 

In the meanwhile I text one friend in the chat freaking out. We talk and somehow she gets upset because she loved me and I “tossed her feelings aside”. So she hates me now. 

Now back onto daisy, I finally check the chat and what’s there is along the lines of “my boyfriends a nice guy and I really like him and I’m feeling good in general. [my name], if you wanna talk we can, if not that’s okay”.

But I don’t wanna talk, I just want to fade into darkness and be forgotten.

We cleared it up later but... the shame will never be gone. And I don’t feel comfortable talking to her anymore... and it’s my fault.

tl;dr: irritated my skin and sunburned myself. After that I accidentally reveal a little too much in a group chat I thought my best friend wasn’t in and potentially ruined my relationship permanently.

I was at Coachella and met a girl on Saturday afternoon at the festival.  We ended up spending most of the afternoon together, did some molly together, got really drunk and turned on together, and couldn't keep our hands off each other.  We were fooling around all over the festival, telling each other all of the dirty things we were going to do to each other, and even started messing around a few times until we came back to reality.

&amp;#x200B;

We couldn't take much more and ended up leaving the festival early and going back to where she was staying with her friends in this really cool modern house.   It's walking distance, (a bit of a long walk) but we are able to finally get there and by the time we get inside we are ravaging each other.  We go to her bedroom, and the lights are off and its really dark and there are numerous ""switches"" on the wall.  I'm wasted and so turned on, and I hit all of them trying to figure out how to see.  First its too bright, then its pitch black, finally I figure it out and its perfect mood lighting.

&amp;#x200B;

We start undressing and hooking up, clothes everywhere, mouths and tongues and hands everywhere.  We fuck in a variety of positions, we're sweating and hot, the whole thing is just perfect.  She cums a couple of a times, but I'm pretty high and having a hard time cumming.  She wants me to finish so she starts to suck me off, and starts playing with my ass.  It feels so good, I love it so much and its rare a girl goes for my ass.  She sees that I love it and starts to lick my ass, and at this point im in fucking heaven! 

&amp;#x200B;

I want more, so I get up and get on the bed on all fours, and she is off the bed on her knees and starts licking my ass, stroking my cock from behind and putting her fingers in.  she puts her finger in my ass while she is licking around it and gripping my cock, and finally I can't take it any more and I cum, so hard and so much all over the bed.  She starts to suck a little bit of it out but I'm so sensitive, and we just collapse on the bed.   

&amp;#x200B;

I realize its much brighter in the room than it was before and I go to turn the lights down, and look to my side and realize that one of the entire walls of the room is glass.  I'm looking directly into the living room at a crowd of her friends, all pretending to not have seen what is going on.  I hit some of the switches on the wall and suddenly the glass becomes frosted.  I hit the switch again and the glass becomes clear.  Again, frosted.  She is looking at me in horror as realize we didn't have the privacy glass on the whole time.

I put it on and we bury our faces in the bed in embarrassment.  Luckily for me, these are not my friends and I am not staying there, so I tell her I'm just going to go.

HitchSlap32,bavsb6,"This happened about a year ago. Was on a trip with two of my mates and my beautiful dog. We were hiking on some trail, and we came across an electric cattle fence which I tried to convince my mates is totally harmless and just stings a bit if you touch it. Obviously they were not inclined to touch it, so I told them ""look"", lifting my dog's *very fluffy* tail just a bit towards the copper wire. Unbeknownst to me, fur is an extremely good conduit. The moment some of her tail's fir touched that wire, she leaped forward while putting out the most heartbreaking cry I've ever heard.

Nerdy_Aspie622,awr2lt,"Ok, so I'll need to provide a little background info first. First of all, this didn't actually happen today. This happened a couple of days after Valentine's Day of this year. I was accompanying my mother to a chocolate tasting event. She's a chocoholic, so my father bought her tickets to this event as a gift (one for her plus one guest). Unfortunately, he was busy with work that night, so he asked me to come home from university and accompany her. Now, I mentioned that I am Muslim in the title and this is true. However, my parents are not: they are Christians; I converted in October of last year. Still, they do not drink on principle. For those who don't know, Islam does not allow alcohol consumption while Christianity does. I'm also 18 and therefore not legally allowed to drink anyway. Now, it is not immediately apparent that I am Muslim because I am VERY white and I don't wear the hijab full time (only when at a mosque and/or while praying), especially not when I'm with my parents (who don't exactly approve of my conversion).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto the story.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my mother and I arrived at the venue. We sampled almost every table, with the obvious exception of the vendors giving out alcohol samples, and were enjoying ourselves. Eventually, we reached a table where the women giving out samples are explaining their chocolates (most vendors did not do this). We were given three samples. Two of them were fine: one milk chocolate covered caramel (which was delicious), and a dark chocolate from Madagascar. Then, we were given a third chocolate. I bit into it and thought, ""Mmm! This has a nice raspberry undertone. Raspberry and chocolate pair so well together!"" Then, the vendor explained that the chocolate was made with rose (sorry that my keyboard does not allow the ""e"" to have an accent). Now, I don't know that much about wine, but I recognized that rose was a type of wine. I stopped chewing immediately. As the meme goes, ""it was at this moment that I knew... I fucked up."" I thought, ""SHIT! HOW DO I HANDLE THIS?!"" I ran over to the nearest trashcan, bumping into some people and ironically running past a vendor handing out beer samples in the process, and spit the chocolate out. I then walked back and apologized to the vendor, explaining that my religion prohibits alcohol consumption. I can forgive her for not realizing this; like I said, you definitely can't tell that I'm Muslim by looking at me. She was thankfully not offended, but I was still quite embarrassed. My mother and I then moved along and acted like nothing happened.

&amp;#x200B;

When I told an imam (Islamic clergy) friend of mine about this, he laughed hysterically and assured me that I was in the clear because I did not intend to consume alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I attended a chocolate tasting event with my mother and unknowingly ate a chocolate made with wine, therefore accidentally violating a rule of my religion. When I was made aware of my mistake, I made a fool of myself by running over to a trashcan to spit the chocolate out.

P.S. I also fucked up by not including a TL;DR the first time I posted this. I'm obviously new at this.

I told him I was an info leaker who released a bunch of IPs to the public and that I wanted to know how he doxxes, as a joke of course, but this kid takes me seriously and, thinking this is an opportunity to redeem himself, he calls me disgusting and a scumbag and tells me he's screenshotted my DMs.

So I think, ""oh. shit. he didn't take that joke very well. this could end badly."" He shares my DMs with a high ranking member of one of the servers I'm in, and the HR is all like, ""@(myname). You've been a very bad boy."" So instantly, I'm like ""FUUUUCK. THIS IS THE WORST MISTAKE I'VE EVER MADE!"" I try to defend myself and say I'm joking, but this certain moderator didn't have corpus delicti in mind, and gave me a ban.

So with a sick feeling in my stomach, I try to get entry back into the server by describing my situation to 2 other servers, and I'm kicked from those as well. At this time, I now have a nice little card with my name on it on the first server's trello reading ""(myname): DOXXING/LEAKING IP ADDRESSES -- PERMAMENT, NOT APPEALABLE"".

At first, I thought the moderator was trolling me or joking around, because there was literally no proof to back up my claims. I also thought he was joking because he was being extra dickish about it than he should've. Funny thing is, there are no rules against joking in this manner, so it would have been more appropriate for me to receive a warning. Oh well.

So I grab some stress food and wallow in sadness as everyone proceeds to frown on me. Oh, and the kid who reported my joke then went and used the term ""we"" to describe him and the mods' stance on my situation. He THEN proceeded to go ask them to read over his blacklist appeal again after I'd been kicked (you know, because the whole point of reporting my joke was to show them he was a changed man or something), but luckily he's been denied again.

This was such a stupid mistake. All I had to do was make an alt to DM the guy in the first place and none of this shit would have went down. Also, I understand that it's kind of pathetic to be throwing a tantrum over being kicked out of a few discord servers, but I worked for high ranks in those servers...being kicked out kind of broke me.

Why the fuck did I ask for doxxing methods from a guy who was blacklisted for doxxing and was trying to redeem himself?

tl;dr Saw a guy in a blacklist channel trying to appeal for doxxing. Joked around by posing as some kind of hacker and asked him for his methods, guy saw it as an opportunity to redeem himself to the mods by showing them his new views on doxxing and info leaking, got me banned from several servers.",tifu,TIFU by pretending to be a doxxer and info leaker and got kicked from a few discord servers
maggiedancer,b931zp,"I’m a part time student. I’m 19 and athletic. I have a few ways to make money. But my primary gig is working the desk at a high end hotel. I figured that looks better on my resume. It’s the the type of place that costs too much because of location and because it’s frequented by business travelers and I’m required to wear a jacket, blouse, and slacks or skirt. It’s a good, professional look and I get a lot of male attention. 

Sometimes too much. I’ve been propositioned more than once.  Sometimes for dates. Often more direct “will you come to my room” type offers. They’re almost never the type of men who would appeal to a young woman. 

But recently it was from a guy in his mid-30s (I’ve seen his ID). He’s European. He’s been in a few times. He obviously successful. He always gets a room high up and they cost substantially more. He’s asked me up to his room in a joking way a few times. I flirt (not just with him, I like when customers mention me to management). But I’ve never acted. But this time he came in and said he’s had a horrible day of travel and been delayed all day and was next to someone with body odor on a long flight. He outright told me if I’d come to his room after my shift then he’d give me $500. 

I tried to play it off and told him he could probably find a pro. He said he didn’t want someone who fucks for a living. And he didn’t want a dirty stripper that everyone has touched. He wanted someone innocent and young with a good job. And if I came up To his room could have the cash even if nothing happened. 

Again I played it off. He opened his billfold and started counting off hundreds. 

Then I told him I just couldn’t because I’m a virgin. I thought this would get him to leave me alone 

He immediately offered $2k. I think my eyes popped out of head. But my gut reaction was to say no. 

He offered $2500 and then $3k. I was stunned. And then he said the offer stands all week. Three thousand, but I had to spend the night and give him my virginity. 

I thought about it for 24 hours and decided to go through with it. I didn’t see him that day, but the next day I caught him walking in and told him I was willing but it couldn’t be at the hotel where I worked because there are too many ways I could get caught and lose my job. He agreed on going elsewhere. Then he slipped me $200 to buy “adult lingerie” and a good dress. 

At the planned time I met him at a different hotel in his room wearing a new dress and a lingerie set from VS. We had room service in his suite. 

Then we had sex. He was gentle. Then we did some other stuff and more sex. Then repeated again. In the morning he handed me an envelope with $3k in hundred dollar bills and said he hadn’t been with a virgin in a long time and loved it. Then I left, showered at home, and put his cash in the bank. 

It was a good experience. I don’t have any regrets. I could use the money. The only thing is...I wasn’t really a virgin. And...when I’m not in school or at the hotel I work part time as “a dirty stripper...” And now I’m a sex worker.

TrustMeImAGiraffe,bcwzrt,"First off me and my cousin have been hooking up for a couple years now. What can i say she's hot and she finds me hot. It was only a matter of time till we'd end up sleeping together. It's a fun way to pass the time when family gatherings get a bit boring. We're both consenting adults, i'm 21 she's 23, so as far as i'm concerned we're doing nothing wrong.

Anyway flash back to February and it's a 2nd cousins wedding. We've been flirting all day and we're booth very drunk. Reception is getting boring so we go make out in the car park. It'a going great i'm thinking i might get some action tonight. I was very wrong.

Queue my dad popping out for a quick smoke with my brother and uncle (her dad).  Bear in mind at this point my hands are up her dress greeting Mrs Muff. They see us. I tried to think of some sort of excuse but come up blank. Queue a lot of WTF's and laughing from my brother (he was also very drunk). It's all a bit awkward.

They've all agreed to pretend it was a big drunken mistake. They're not telling anyone else. I don't even think my brother remembers (thank god). We haven't told them about the three times we had actual sex, gonna keep that on the down low.

I'm seeing her again in summer, gonna have to be much more careful this time.

If anyone was wondering we live in the UK so this is all legal.

SpecialSpnk,b2s6nv,"Yes this happened, this incident happened today actually, the sex acts happened last night. I decided to stay over their house for a little added privacy and convenience. I live about 15 min away and have a roomate. My parents have a big gorgeous house on the water. 

Well my step father made what I perceieved to be a joke about cameras in the house less than a week ago. Little did I know, he was not joking in the slightest. Things got hot and heavy the second that a few friends left. We started on the couch in the living room, absolutely going to town. Finished on the couch after about 20 min of hard strong fucking. Started in a type of modified spooning with her leg in the air, ended in doggy at another part of the sectional. She can be very loud and has multiple orgasms very often. The past few times have been even more so because we took a week long hiatus of seeing each other because I did not know if I wanted to be with her. 

Then we had another really intense round 2 upstairs In my mother's room before bed. This was actually the second time in about a week. Got caught the first time as well. That is another story. 

Anyways, I get an angry message from my step father this morning that reads like this. 

""You have NO IDEA how pissed off we are with you right now. WTF did you think you were doing using the house again as you did? You think there will be no repercussion's because of this you are most mistaken.STRONGLY advise you to get any of your stuff/lady friends out of the place, clean up your mess, and stay out of the house until we return.""

It didn't get much better from here and ended with a couple more strongly worded statements 

"" If car was on their private property, like our driveway, the county can't fine them. Only on the public street. That's why you put it at our house, so their property is not private, but public parking. Secondly, you will not find any of the 4 remote camera's so stop looking as it will just piss me off to watch you ""searching"" our rooms, where you should not be anyways. The camera's are audio also. Your young lady is quite vocal when aroused.

Throwaway because most of my family knows my main.

Now for some context, My GF Is best friends with my sister, And my sister is obsessed, and I mean OBSESSED with makeup and constantly changes her style, But the downside to that is that sometimes she looks like a completely different person. I'm sure you can kinda see where this is going from the title.

So my GF (Who i live with) was out with her family for her birthday and since I'd just had a LOOONG shift at work, I Was lying in bed on my phone, And eventually I got pretty horny, So my horny brain decided to crank one out. I Was scrolling through ol' reliable PH and not paying much attention, and I saw a video with (What i thought was) a pretty hot looking girl, So naturally, I Watched it. I Remember thinking ""Ha, She has my sister's name"" when I saw the account's name, But my dumbass brain didn't realise or think much about it. While I was about halfway through the act, My GF must have come home early, because she opened our bedroom door to see my on my bed, On my phone, with my pants down (Our bedroom door is at an angle where she could clearly see what I was watching), And the next thing I remember is her screaming ""What the fuck is wrong with you!?"" And taking my phone once she saw what I was watching. She ran out of our room with my phone and got into her car and drove off.

**Oh shit**.

I Opened ""Find my iPhone"" on my laptop to see where she (and my phone) was and saw her pulling into my sister's driveway. It's been an hour and she's still there, and she and my sister have blocked me on everything I use to contact them, And now I'm writing this to pass the time until she gets home. I'm fucked.

Ok, so, this happened about 4 hours and 20 minutes ago. Everyone in my house was asleep, so I thought, ""You know what, fuck it, everyone's asleep and I am feeling kinda horny since my BF was teasing me earlier"" and I began to finger my vagina. It felt good, and after 1 minute I started with my ass too. After about 2 minutes I felt a slight pain in my tailbone area, and being my stupid self, assumed it was nothing, and that it would fade away, so I continued with my actions. After another 2 minutes, the pain had nearly doubled in severity, but I still told myself it was nothing. After another so many minutes (I lost track at this point) I had finished, but the pain had went from, ""Meh, it's probably nothing"" to ""FUCK!! IT HURTS TO SIT DOWN!!"" I still assumed it was nothing and attempted to sleep. Ffwd to now, my tailbone is still hurting worse than my Dad's hip on a rainy day (he had a surgery at 8 or something because there was a BIG issue with the bone and cartilage in his hip. There was little to no cartilage whatsoever. Now, the ball is shaped like an oval). I still can't sleep and it is 4:21 AM. If I wasn't stupid and stopped when I noticed the pain was growing, I would be asleep rn. I have to get up on Tuesday at 6:20 AM for school and my sleep schedule is out of wack.

PhoenixScorpion,akbs60,"This happened back when I was getting treated for cancer years ago.  I had a dating profile on a few sites explaining my situation.  Basically cancer gets you a lot of easy one night stands.  I'd always have something set up the day I got out.  

My oncologist briefly mentioned to ware a condom if I had sex, and not to make out with anyone.  Here is where the fuck up happened, I just thought the condom was to prevent a chemo baby.  How did I explain not being able to make out with anyone?  Chemo lowers your immune system, I thought it was to protect me from germs.

Part of the treatment is red blood cell replacement, and a white cell booster.  Plus steroids and opioids, basically I was a cumming machine after my treatments.

I would tell my hookups about this one day of stamina and always found one willing to suck me completely dry and then some.  Some even thought I should cum inside of them because their birth control had never failed them before.

Then today I see u/seven3three post about her bfs chemo making her sick.  I read some comments, and realized all those nuts were chemo containing ones.

Sanreign,aimz5p,"   Obligatory this didn’t happen today but a couple days ago. Before I begin, I am only posting this because of the irony of everything and because as much as it hurts I still need to look for the humor in things.


   A bit of background to understand the FU, my ex and I had been in a long term relationship for about 4 years and it was a bit rocky for various reasons. We broke up twice before this but quickly got back together both times. The first time I admit is my fault because I was too independent for someone in a relationship. I wasn’t as open and liked to do things alone which is a recipe for disaster when you are trying to be with someone. Anyway after a long night of reflection, I realized I didn’t want to lose her so I wrote her promising to change and we got back together again. The second time, I would say both parties were to blame as we were still trying to fix issues we were dealing with. This time around she was the one that wanted to get back together and I was hesitant but happy to get back and so we did.


   Around this time, I started looking for other ways to improve myself in the relationship and found the subreddit. Though the subreddit isn’t specifically for relationship advice, some posts and especially comments give a lot of insight and really helpful advice. It gave me some tips on how to fix some things I didn’t realize were problems, I needed another perspective to see and understand. It helped me fix a lot of things, so I recommended we both read through some of the posts on the subreddit to identify red flags and work on them before it was too late. Well cue the fuck up, I read a particular post and for some reason it stood out to me and gave me a new perspective on how bad my attitude was in that respect. I saved it and made a mental reminder to show it to her later in the day.


   Fast-forward to later in the day and I show it to her, she reads it and after says that she can relate which kills me on the inside. She also says this is why she barely reads the subreddit because of realizations like that, another bad sign. We get to talking and one thing led to another and we decided it wasn’t the best idea to remain together. And that folks, is how I ended up being single. If I could go back and change anything and maybe not show her the post, I wouldn’t.


TLDR; Tried to fix my bad attitude and save my relationship by showing ex a reddit post to get her opinion, ended up breaking up with her as a mutual decision.

Cold_Astronomer,amjn5t,"Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.  

**Backstory:**

So my computer died because the motherboard was broken. I ordered a new one, but it would take a week for it to be delivered. Because of this, there was no way that I could connect to the internet. Another piece of technology that I own is one of those old Nokia's (I wish I was joking).
But obviously, I cannot go on the internet with this thing.  

The only way that I would be able to connect to the internet, was by using my mom's or dad's computer. I could just ask them nicely if I can use one of their computers for a few hours. But I only need internet access for one specific thing, well, XXX videos (I also have needs, don't judge me). I can't just use one of their PC's and watch porn while they can bust me at any moment. I needed to be home alone in order to do it without getting caught.  

I was actually in luck because my dad told me that he and my mom were invited to some party on a Saturday night. As soon as I heard that, I thought to myself: ""Hell yeah"". This would also be the perfect moment because my parents usually don't come home before midnight when they go to parties. So I knew I would have plenty of time to do my thing.  

**What happened that Saturday night:**

It was around 8:00 PM and my parents said goodbye to me before they left for the party. About 5 minutes after they left, I looked out the window to see if they were gone. When as I saw that the coast was clear, I ran to my dad's room and turned his PC on. As the PC was booting up, I grabbed a few wipes and laid them between the keyboard and the edge of the table.  

I was sooo ready to bust a nut. You had no idea... So I opened the browser with an incognito tab and looked for some videos on a few raunchy websites. I found them and started doing my thing. It lasted for about 10 minutes, then I was about to nut. But because the desk height was set pretty high, it was kind of hard to aim if you know what I mean. So I came, but I ended up missing the wipes. Instead, everything landed on the keyboard... EVERYTHING. After about two seconds of realizing what just happened, I said to myself: ""Fuck"".  

I had no idea what to do. Just imagine what my dad would say if he found out... What would you do if you saw that your keyboard was full of cum after you were gone? I used the wipes that I missed to clean the keycaps. After that, I googled things like ""how to remove semen from keyboard"". But while I was typing, I noticed that the keys had become very sticky.  

A few sources said the best way to clean a keyboard, was to wash the keycaps with water and to clean the base with a watered q-tip.
Unfortunately, after removing some keycaps, I noticed that the sperm had already penetrated the plungers. This was apparent, as some of the keys stopped working and some activated themselves at random moments. So cleaning it wasn't really an option anymore.  

I decided to call my best friend to see if he had a solution.
He's the type of guy who usually knows the solution to any problem. So I called him and told him the entire story. As soon as I said the word ""keyboard"", he started laughing really hard. It was also one of those retarded laughs, and it lasted for about 10 seconds. I said to him ""Dude, I'm in serious trouble. What's the best thing I can do?"". He simply replied ""Good luck"", and hung up the phone.  

My friend wasn't very helpful. So I had to think of a solution myself. After about 10 minutes of brainstorming, I came up with this genius idea. I would destroy the keyboard using a hammer and throw it in the bin afterwards. As soon as my dad gets home, I will just tell him that I got angry after losing in some computer game. He would obviously get mad at me, but I will just get him a new one. It's one of those cheap Logitech keyboards, so it would only set me back at around 20 bucks. I laid the keyboard on the floor, took a sledgehammer from the shed and started beating the crap out of it. After the keyboard looked pretty beat up and most of the keys have flown off, I took it and threw it in the bin.  

My parents came home at around 00:30 AM. As soon as my dad opened the door, I told him that I played a game on his PC and got really mad because I lost. So I ended up destroying the keyboard. He gave me a dirty look and asked ""Really? Where is it?"". I said: ""It's in the bin. But don't worry about it, I'll buy you a new one"". To which he replied, ""Can't we just fix it?"". Then I said ""Uhm, I don't think so. It's really beat up and it doesn't work anymore"". He said, ""I'll see what I can do..."".  

I thought to myself ""He's not actually going to fish it out of the bin, is he?"". I really hoped he wasn't, because I didn’t clean the base of the keyboard. Meaning the cum was still in there. He took the keyboard out of the bin and brought it to his room. I thought to myself ""Oh, no, will I have to find a new family?"". I walked to his room to see what he was going to do with it.  

He placed the keyboard on his desk and pushed a few of the buttons that were still on there. Then he looked at me like I had just committed a serious crime and asked: ""Why are the keys so stiff?"". I simply replied ""I don't know"" like I had nothing to do with it. Then I walked away.  

This happened one hour ago.
Haven't talked to my dad since then.
I posted this story using my mom's PC.  

TL;DR:
Jizzed all over my dad's keyboard. Instead of cleaning it, I destroyed the keyboard with a sledgehammer and threw it in the bin so he wouldn't find out. Wanted to buy him a new one, but he ended up fishing the broken keyboard out of the bin to see if he could fix it.

serialassslapper69,boiuq4,"Title. We were playing pool at the bar we both work in after we closed, and she was kinda ahead with the drinks. She said “i’m wearing really ugly underwear right now

To which I replied “what do you mean?”

“Well slap my ass to see what I mean”


So I went for it. Twice. 

Today she really looks pissed at me. Also AITA?

How fucked am I if she’s going to tell the boss? I’m 27 she’s 19. Also post is very short that’s it really so here is a lasagna recipe.

I’ve been on the quest for the perfect lasagna for years. I can tell you right now that this recipe is the ultimate lasagna recipe. It’s absolute perfection and possibly the world’s best lasagna! You won’t need another recipe ever again.

 


WHAT KIND OF SAUCE SHOULD I USE FOR LASAGNA?

The best lasagna recipe ever starts out with a homemade bolognese sauce. Bolognese sauce is a meat based sauce that gets its name because it originates in Bologna, Italy. In this recipe I’ve used a combination of lean ground beef and Italian style ground sausage. You’ll want to be sure to use a lean ground beef (93/7) for best results so that the sauce doesn’t end up greasy.

The sauce builds flavor with minced onion and garlic. You’ll want to make sure to mince your onions (a very small dice) because you don’t want the sauce to end up being too chunky. We are going for the ideal texture here and the only chunks in the sauce should be from the meat.

 

TOMATO PASTE: You’ll notice that two cans of tomato paste are used in this recipe. Yes, that’s a ton of tomato paste! Tomato paste has a super concentrated tomato flavor. By adding in so much paste we’re able to up the saturation of the tomato flavor, without adding too much liquid into the sauce. It’s thinned out with just a bit of chicken broth.

 

HERBS: The blend of herbs included in this bolognese is absolute perfection. I’ve used fresh parsley and fresh basil and combined it with dried oregano and the key to all the flavor: fennel seeds. You need the fennel seeds for that authentic flavor.

 


SIMMER TIME: The sauce develops flavor as it simmers. It needs to be simmered for a minimum of 1 hour to give you the most amazing lasagna, but you can simmer it up to 4 hours for maximum flavor results. It’s worth every second and doesn’t require much effort at all. If you don’t want to leave it simmering on the stove, you can always transfer it all to a slow cooker and simmer it in there on high for 4 hours.

 

WHAT KIND OF CHEESE SHOULD I USE FOR LASAGNA?

There are three sources of cheese in this recipe. First you have the classic lasagna filling of ricotta cheese. Use whole milk ricotta cheese in this recipe for best results. This recipe isn’t about skimping! I’ve kept the ricotta filling quite simple and added just a touch of ground nutmeg for authentic flavor. The egg acts as a binding agent and gives the filling the ideal texture.

 

The second source of cheese is sliced mozzarella cheese. I had my mozzarella sliced at the deli counter in my grocery store. You want fairly thin slices. 24 slices is the ideal amount and it should equal somewhere around 1 pound.



Third, you’ll need freshly grated parmesan cheese. Don’t use shredded, you’ll want grated for best results. Also, don’t use that canned stuff. It doesn’t melt the same as real, freshly grated parmesan cheese.

 

Lasagna Pasta Shortcut: I’ve given you the best hack ever for your lasagna noodles and included it as part of the recipe. No boil lasagna noodles work, but they often end up a bit of an odd texture and absorb too much liquid in the recipe. Instead, I use regular lasagna noodles and STILL don’t boil them. All you have to do is place them into a container and pour hot water over them. Let them soak for 30 minutes and they’ll be tender enough to use in the recipe.

I'm in Lisbon and I met a girl at my hostel over some drinking games. We ended up going out into the night together for a bite and decided to go to a nightclub that others from our hostel were going to. We had a few drinks and danced, but I was starting to get introverted and tired and wanted to leave. She wanted to stay, so I asked if it would be weird if I wanted to kiss her and she said not at all, so I did.


That's not the kiss, though.


I got back to the hostel and laid in bed for an hour or so on reddit, and she and another guy from our room both came back in at the same time. She got changed quickly and they both left again for another hour, and I guess I didnt think much about it since I was still drunk. Later they both came back again and she came over to my bed and held my hand, saying she had a fun night and wanted to meet up with me back in New York when she got home. I felt like maybe theres this connection, so after she said good night, I pulled her close and gave her another quick kiss. Only this time, she had a look of ""uuuuhh"" on her face. She got up and went to her bed, and the guy who came in with her had stripped down to his underwear, walked across the room and also got in her bed.


And then it began to slowly dawn on me. Oh, so she likes him instead. Hmm, there definitely had to have been some chemistry tonight leading up to him getting into her bed almost naked. They came and went a couple of times and she got changed into something looser.... that kiss seemed different than earlier.... oh.... oh no....


Fortunately, my flight was in a few hours, so I didnt have to sit in that uncomfortable room any longer and packed and left. Brushed my teeth. Smoked a few cigarettes. Never messaged her to confirm it, but, if they're sharing a bed nearly naked with someone she met a few hours ago and they've been together all night, then it's pretty clear they were doing more than kissing and dancing. I definitely kissed a chick who at least sucked this guys dick.

Cdchrono,bkk35x,"So, its pretty simple.  I was cashing my last paycheck (cause I just got fired) in a part of town I wouldn't normally go to,  it is where the office is) and someone stopped me an asked for a lighter.  Before I knew it, I was hit in the head hard with something and I went flying on my back, losing consciousness.
I woke up and all my shit was gone except for my shitty phone (including my bicycle).
God I'm so stupid.

Now I'm just really fucked and am seriously considering suicide.  After a long stint of homelessness, I finally got a new job and found a room to rent with friends, which has lasted for the last 3 months and been wonderful.  Now I've been fired for being late because I ride a bike 7 miles to work and shit happens sometimes, and I had just enough to pay the rent and get another job before next month.  Now I'm just gonna be homeless again with no resources, just like that.

moma_cat,bkyagg," I have been in a long-term relationship with someone who I consider my best friend and my soul mate for the entire duration of college into professional career. Unfortunately, I fucked everything up.

A person I met relatively recently started texting me and what not. I ate lunch with her about four times and we were texting. I thought nothing of it at the time, because I did not think she showed any interest in me. I did not tell my partner, because I figured it would just be a pain to explain and what not. This was my first big fuck up. I have always kept other women far away, and this is something out of the norm. I am being honest with myself when I say I really did not have an interest in this relationship. As for the secrecy, I have no idea how it spiraled out. It was just a thing because I couldn't be bothered to explain.

At a certain point, this new person asked me to a movie, and a drink, despite full knowledge of my long-term relationship. I declined both, and kept a further distance. Finally, on the third request for drinks, I went, and wanted to end everything there. I shouldn't have, but I wanted to end this, and return to normalcy.

I blacked out and I realized I had cheated on my girlfriend. I was in the other person's house, in her bed. Now, this new person is not the type of person to spike drinks (I did not try to make it sound like that, but it came out that way), so it's all on me. I betrayed my best friend and partner in life and I cannot understand how I could have done something like this. I have never done so reprehensible, and it goes against everything I have. I was so happy with my life. And it is definitely my fault. Alcohol definitely does not excuse what happened, nor do my past actions warrant any excuse. I failed to be upfront to a genuinely great person and betrayed their trust. 

I feel too guilty to tell anybody about my looming sense of physical violation I feel. As a man, I do not think I will get any pity for feeling violated. But being so inebriated and having thrown up repeatedly that night... I cannot voice this to anybody because I will seem like a scum attempting to play the victim. And I lost my best friend. And I feel so alone. I have never broken down in such a manner and I do not know what to do. I don't even know why I am posting this.

mcyf,9a5mnn,"This happened last year before Christmas and I’ve finally come to terms with the set of events that had happened. There were more crazy events leading up to this tournament but I shall save that for another time.

I was part of the debate team in my university in Singapore and my partner and I were representing our university in a few countries in the region. I’m a Malaysian but have been studying in Singapore for a few years. I’ve never really liked the country due to its archaic rules and the way the government forces its people to conform to ridiculous rules. With that said, I love smoking week and having a good time so Singapore was a bit of a headache to live in.

As part of the competition, we were to stay in a hostel with the rest of students competing. It was awesome as I got to meet people of various nationalities and most of them enjoy smoking weed and partying. We went to Cambodia for this tournament and I was looking forward to getting high and having a fun time with new friends. Before I move on, I must let you know about my debate partner. He’s an extremely religious person who frowns up alcohol consumption and drug usage. Sexual activities is a big no-no too. He’s a good lad but his judgmental stares and talks get to me at times.

After the first day, we did fine and went back to the hostel to rest. I met this gorgeous Irish chick and we clicked immediately. After downing a couple of drinks, I went for the move and asked her back to my room(which I shared with my partner). She was giggling and we were on our way. Seeing it was past midnight, I assumed he was fast asleep and there wouldn’t be any issues. I was wrong. He was awake and gave me a dressing down in front of the girl. She was so upset that she left the room and I was stranded with blue balls and a raging urge to murder my partner. 

I was in a rage and left the room, thinking of ways to make the night less sucky. Went out for a smoke and met some Arab students who were taking part in the tournament too. They said they wanted to smoke weed and we decided to try finding some. In my experience with South East Asian countries, the taxi/tuk tuk drivers was the best way to get the supply. We hailed for a tuk tuk right outside the hostel and I asked the driver to bring us to a place where we could get weed. He said it would be 50USD for the weed and 10USD for the ride. Felt it was a bit of a ripoff but the Arab students were way too excited to even negotiate. We got onto the tuk tuk and he brought us to a place about 20 minutes away from the hostel.

Now this place looks dodgy as it was really dark and he was driving us into an alley. For a moment I thought we were about to be robbed but true to his words, he dropped us off and a guy came to pass us the weed. We decided to light up there and it was just less than 5 minutes before 2 police cars came over. The mother fucker tuk tuk driver had sold us out and it was a ploy from the start. The police inspector insisted on bringing us back to the station and getting us locked up and I knew that we could get out of this by giving them what they wanted - money. The Arabs were terrified and it made matters worse. The inspector knew we were inexperienced and demanded 500USD. The Arabs immediately agreed without negotiating again and I was pissed. I told the inspector we had to go back to the hostel to get the money and he brought us back in their car. The Arabs decided on splitting it 4 ways and I had to cough up 125USD. I only had 300USD with me and it was really maddening. Paid up and I went to the rooftop in more anger.

Feeling frustrated, I needed a drink badly and decided to walk out to find a truck bar- a bar serving drinks out of the back of a truck and there were make shift seats nearby. Drinks were really cheap - 1USD a pint and I had a good time. Was never really a good drinker but the cheap prices got to me and I must have downed about 10 pints. Was too smashed and ended up sleeping on the road and woke up in the morning only to realise I missed my debate preliminary session. Partner was pissed but I assured him that we could make it up the next day.

I spent the day practising our material before heading out in the evening to the truck bar again. Once again, was smashed but this time a girl approached me and started flirting with me. Hormones took over and I followed her to a hotel for a fun time. I was really drunk but was feeling excited to get laid when disaster struck. She said I had to pay her 50USD for sex and the room. She was a working girl and I was duped! Feeling frustrated and horny, I decided to pay her and waited for her to shower. The alcohol kicked in and I ended up falling asleep. Fuck my life.

The calamity didn’t end there. When I got up, I realised my wallet and phone were missing. The girl had pilfered them without mercy. Immediately went to the counter and they couldn’t speak a word of English. Felt like strangling myself for being an idiot. I used their phone to contact my partner to pick me up and oh boy was he pissed. At this point we couldn’t proceed further in the tournament and had to give up since we were disqualified. My partner wasn’t talking to me and I was having a roller coaster of emotions - both agony and anger. 

I decided to leave my partner alone not to frustrate him further and walked the streets trying to find some solace. Saw another one of those truck bars and decided to get drunk before heading back to Singapore. I got wicked smashed again and another girl approached me. I straight up told her I had no money, not even 10USD left after paying for my drinks. She smiled and flirted with me and I was charmed. She brought me to her house and I was too drunk to resist.

All I remembered was laying in her bed before passing out. While sleeping, I kept having vivid dreams of taking a massive dump on the bed. It was weird but that was all I could remember. The nightmare started when I woke up.

Groggily, I woke up and I was naked on the bed. My arse felt like it was on fire and in immense hurt. I could barely move. Turning over, I saw her naked too, with a penis bigger than mine. Immediately, I was awake and my mind went blank. I saw some used condoms on the night stand next to her and quickly put on my clothes, speechless. She tried to talk to me but I was gone. I didn’t know how to even react or think. Quickly took a tuk tuk back to my hostel feeling devastated.

Didn’t speak a word about it to anyone and just went home. I went to a clinic few weeks later to get myself tested and was researching how to live with HIV should I contract it. Thank God I was clean and tried to block the entire incident from my head. Ended up going for school-sponsored therapy sessions and it helped a lot. I just graduated 2 weeks ago and wanted to share my story.

Pikabluee,bju8kl,"So I went to this guy’s hotel room and we had sex. The sex was literally the best I’ve had and he was amazing. Like I always knew I was missing out on something when having sex with my fwb. He’s not terrible but he could be better... He didn’t have as much passion as this other guy did.

Anyway, I’ve been doing a lot of compulsive things lately and not really thinking about my actions due to lack of care. I sent these things to my fwb for reasons I don’t know. Maybe because I wanted to make him jealous or something. It definitely made me feel powerful when I did it. 

Anyway when I went back to my dorm and went to his room to apologize (even though I was high as shit and my apology honestly would be just words flowing out of my mouth). 

Convo went something like this:

Fwb: *opens the door* “Hey, I really don’t wanna hang out right now.”

Me: “I’m sorry. I’m really fucked up right now I wasn’t thinking.”

Fwb: “I’m just gonna play some Xbox....” *awkward silence*

Me: “I didn’t mean to send that stuff. I was being stupid.”

Fwb: “I’m just gonna... go. Yeah.” *shuts door slowly*

Me: “Ok good night.” *continues walking down the hallway*

I’m a bit concerned since I don’t feel as guilty as I should about it. Is that extremely bad? 

Definitely if I hadn’t sent anything he would have never known that I was out with another guy. But the fact that I did makes it seem like I have no respect or regard for him. It’s so shitty and such a messy situation that I’m surprise of myself. It’s probably by far the most mean thing I’ve done and I don’t actively try to be mean to people much less the people that I closely associate with. 

I expected my fwb to at least slap me or something (not that he has ever physically attacked/abused me). I probably deserved a good slap. Or he should have at least shouted at me and cursed me out then SLAMMED the door. I guess he’s too nice for that and/or he just was too fed up to keep the energy going. You know someone is fed up when you can almost hear it over texts.

What do you even say to someone after doing that to them? Nothing? Let them cool off and then talk to them? I’m not scared really I just feel like if I have an apology it’ll come out my ass and won’t be genuine.

Update: I just sent him a text apologizing. I don’t expect him to talk to me again but I’ll see how it goes.

TLDR: I had sex with this dude and sent naked pic and vid or us in bed to my fwb. Went back to his place to apologize and he didn’t want to hear any of it and shut the door in my face.",tifu,TIFU by sending a video and photo of me naked in bed with another guy to my fwb.

falconsomething,b0g9fg,"My fiancée is going away tomorrow on a week-long work trip so I wanted to give her a goodbye “treat.” This entailed a sexy full body massage.

She doesn’t like heavily scented lotions, and we don’t often have any body lotion just laying around. So she chose a lightly scented watermelon face lotion in a tube and placed it on my bedside table... right by my tube of Cortizone-10. 

Of course, she didn’t tell me what lotion she chose, so I naturally grabbed the first tube I saw and went to town. 

A few minutes in she commented she couldn’t smell the watermelon and I noticed pills and rolls of what looked like skin where rolling off her back under my hands. We thought this was weird but chalked it up to the lotion being thick. 

I made my way down the rest of her backside and enjoyed myself there for a while. Then I noticed everything was still flaky and the lotion wasn’t drying. 

Although I reached the end of the massage she asked for some more rubs down south, so I went to grab the tube when she looked up and asked if I had been using my itch cream the whole time... I looked at her confused and said, “No...?” and she encouraged me to look closer. 

After a brief panic (“does my back look weird? I think it feels hot! Wait, this says don’t use near the... inside parts...”) we realized all was fine, just sticky and lotion-y. 

We’re still laughing about it and I sucked up the embarrassment and did go back over with the watermelon face lotion to her enjoyment.

Hot_Tub_Jim,a8dgnr,"I’m currently on probation because I got a misdemeanor DUI for driving my car through my back fence, over a fire hydrant, and into a transformer back in 2016. Before I get into the details of this date, I’m just going to put it out there that I was an absolute shit show from 2014 to 2016. I had gone through a heinous divorce in 2015 that left me shattered and ruined, I had a botched ankle surgery in 2015 that left me on crutches for more than a year and had me seriously considering amputating my leg, and I wound up overdosing on Percocet and Xanax in 2016, which put me in a coma with sepsis and multi-system organ failure. I was living alone and was surrounding myself with depressed alcoholics who just wanted to party with me and gave zero shits about my well-being.

 Anyways, after my DUI, I was put into a diversion court program instead of getting sent to jail for three months, which has been the best thing that’s ever happened in my life. I’ve been forced to go seek counseling, get on proper medication, stop using drugs and alcohol, and start working out regularly. This program has helped me to sweep up the shattered remains of my old self and rebuild myself into something far, far greater. 

Because of this, my ability to love and have confidence in myself has soared, and I’ve been finding myself going out on a lot of dates recently. 
One such date occurred about a month ago with a bodybuilding doctor I met on Bumble. We had gone out for coffee on our first date and came to the conclusion that we both wanted to fuck one another and have fun back at my place on the second date. I wound up making her a nice halibut dinner, had some wine, then took her back to my bedroom for some fun. 

So, this court program I’m in requires me to call in eight times a week to see if my color card is randomly called (twice a day, M-Th). The testing can either be a breathalyzer device, which will detect alcohol for only up to a few hours beforehand, or a UA test, which supposedly detects alcohol up to 80 hours beforehand (it’s more like 24 hours though unless you’re a hardcore alcoholic).

Anyways, the next morning, I call in and my color is called. I go in thinking I’ll be fine since the past few tests were breathalyzers. They weren’t, and I wound up pissing dirty for alcohol and was detained right then and there and sent to jail for the weekend. 

When I got out, I had to go to court, and I was ordered to attend weekend jail for 10 days (5 weeks). Every time I would go in, they would take all my belongings, strip me down, and throw me in a prison jumper. Because I have 15 genital piercings (7 hafada’s ,3 guiche’s, 4 dydoes, and a prince albert) that I refused to take out during my strip search, I was thrown in to solitary confinement on each visit, which meant I had to stay in isolation in my cell for the duration of my stay. One of the jailers in my housing unit was an old friend of mine from high school too, so he wound up giving me no end of his shit while I was in there.

While it was less than ideal to have to go to jail for five weeks, I did find some comfort in it. It was a nice reprieve to have my phone taken away from me for two days, I got a lot of exercise in (squats, calf raises, pushups, situps, wall-sits), and I was able to do a lot of meditation during that time. I also got to hear arguably one of the best conversations known to man transpire between this guy Wilhouse and this compulsive liar, Jake. I’ve transcribed the conversation to the best of my abilities and put it below for your guy’s enjoyment. 

In the end, when I told the hot bodybuilding doctor that I had to go to jail for having an evening with her, she wound up ghosting me and never talked to me again. Fucking bitch.

As an aside, here’s the conversation between Wilhouse and Jake the Snake for your amusement. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did: 

Jake: “Hey! Did you know my hands are certified as deadly weapons?”
Wilhouse: “No shit?! When that’d happen?”
Jake: “When I was five. They had me chop a cadaver in half. You gotta eviscerate them at the sternum in one chop. That’s how they certify you for these things. Hey, did you know that I’m a certified genius too?”
Wilhouse: “What!?! No way, for real?!?”
Jake: “That’s right. I’ve got uhhh, I’ve got a 78.4 IQ. I’m the smartest man on the planet!”
Wilhouse: “That’s your IQ? You dumb as shit Jake! You’d need an IQ of like 300 to be the smartest man on the planet.”
Jake: “No man, I mean, that’s my GPA. I’ve got a 78.4 GPA. Most people can only go to like 4.3, but mine is 78.4. That’s right. My brain is like a computer processor! The government actually used me as an experiment to program their missile defense systems.”
Wilhouse: “Oh shit! Really man! I’ve got a mathematical calculation you could maybe help me out with then. What’s uhhh, 5,682 times 55 divided by rhinoceros?”
Jake: “Fuck you man! Rhinoceros ain’t no mathematical property! You meant triangle, right? Cuz that’s an easy one man! It’s uhhhh 5.323271 triangle!
Wilhouse: “Oh damn! You really are a computer man! Thanks, that one’s been plaguing me for hours now.”
Jake: “Yah man, I’m rich as shit too. That’s what happens when you’ve got a brain as big as mine. I’ve got like 321 trillion sitting in my bank right now. About 22 trillion of that is tied up in this, uh, bracelet that belonged to Cleopatra. It’s got dragons and shit on it that she wore when she was fucking all her concubines. It’s priceless man.”
Wilhouse: “Hey Jake.”
Jake: “Yah?”
Wilhouse: “You homeless, right? Like, you’re living in a tent?”
Jake: “Yah, so what?”
Wilhouse: So where are you keeping this priceless artifact and why don’t you buy yourself a house?”
Jake: “I, uhh, I have it buried out in the woods so no one can steal it. And Fuck you, I’m not buying a house in this shit hole country! My real home is in England.
Wilhouse: “Oh yah! Where at?”
Jake: “It’s in the woods, about a mile north of Buckingham Palace.”
WIlhouse: “What’s your address?”
Jake: “It’s uh, 4737 Sky Harbor Lane.
Wilhouse: “Wait, what was that again?”
Jake: “It’s 3437 Sky Harbor Boulevard! Jesus! Didn’t you hear me the first time?”
Wilhouse: “I thought you said it was 4737 Sky Harbor Lane”
Jake: “Fuck you man! Shut the fuck up! You didn’t hear me right!”
Wilhouse: “Hey Jake?!?”
Jake: “Yah”
Wilhouse: “You ever kill a black mamba?”
Jake: “Yessir! With my bare hands. Jumped on top of it and tore it apart. Cooked it up and it was good too. You ever ear Black Mamba before? It’s like eating turkey. Can’t eat the face though cuz that’s where all the poison is.”
Wilhouse: “Damn Jake, you could blooded!”
Jake: “That’s right! That’s why they call me Jake the Snake! Well that and because I love eating dick. I make kind of a slithering sound when I’m sucking on a cock. But I only do it for money! Last guy paid me like $100 to suck his dick, but then I went and fucked these two bitches in a closet afterwards. Well, one was a bitch, and the other was a bitch but with a dick, so like a dude. But yah man, I’m Bi and proud of it!
Wilhouse: “Yo Jake! What’s 500 billion divided by the square root of a trapezoid?”
Jake: “Shiiiiit, you joking, right? That’s easy as pie. The answer is 15 trapezoid!”
Wilhouse: “Damn Jake! I should have you do my tax returns!”
Jake: “Nah man, you wouldn’t want that. You’d get the IRS all up in your business asking how you got the biggest tax refund for the year. It’d all be 100% legit because I know all the loopholes and shit, but you don’t want that kind of terror on you. I’m just watching out for you man.”
Wilhouse: “Thanks dawg! You real homie!”

Ushouldknowthat,b5oiok,"I am ONLY posting this because my kids think it's fucking hysterical. I think it's one of the worst things I've ever done as a parent. (happened a couple months ago) 

&amp;#x200B;

\*deep breath\*

&amp;#x200B;

My boy has autism. He's 14 and, if you didn't know he was autistic, you would never know. He recently started attending public high school w/his 16 yr old sister. Due to some reading issues, he was homeschooled grades 5-8. I, as you can imagine, was worried about him making friends or falling in with the wrong crowd. Since he'd never dealt with peer pressure before, I worried he may be susceptible to it.

Now I am a good mom. I watch their internet history's and every picture they take goes right to my google photos. 

One day, I decide to organize my pics. I see some recents by my son. It's a couple of close ups of he and a friend (whom i know to be trouble) making what I thought was a right-surpremacist hand gesture.

I was LIVID! What right does my autistic kid have to judge people on traits they can't control?

I got in my van (mini, bitches, i ride in style), drove to the school and had them pull his ass out of class. We go to the car and I hit the roof. I was told I used the term ""white supremacist propaganda"" but I don't remember. It's all a blur. I tell him to get his butt back to class and we'll talk more later.

He goes back in and spends the day wondering ""Am I a white-supremacist?"" and being totally confused.

Skip ahead a few hours. Son gets on the school bus looking like someone killed his dog. My daughter immediately asks him what's up. He says, ""mom pulled me out of school to yell at me,"". Daughter gasps, asks if I found a dick pic. He shakes his head, about to cry. ""I just did this"" and shows her the gesture. She says, ""No. Really. What did you do?"" He whispers, ""I think I'm a white supremacist"", drops his head, and my daughter realizes he's telling the truth. That's when she started laughing, hard. Like, hysterically hard.

Did any other ladies over 35 know that boys and men have a dick-punching game? That's right. They made a game out of punching each other in the nuts. A game. 

Now, the way you play is to make a specific hand gesture on your leg. Get the other guy to look and BOOM! DICK PUNCH.

I now know they play this in grade school, middle school, high school, college, the military, certain workplaces, home, etc. All ages can join. All you gotta have is a penis. This was made explicitly clear to me that afternoon by my super pissed husband and laughing children. 

I asked why the photo if it's a game? Son said it was just a new level of deception in the game. He's dedicated, I'll give him  that.

anhojan,ay5asx,"So my SO used to be a stoner. And we're not talking 2 joints on the weekend, we're talking living on toast for weeks because all the money went to weed. So him smoking is a bit of a touchy subject for me. Especially since he has tried and failed to only smoke a little.

Also, we have a kid big enough to walk and dumb enough to use this skill mostly to carry containers to exciting new locations to tip them out.

Today, before I got home from work, apparently the kid got his hands on a bag full of cookies and was having a blast tipping out the crumbs generously everywhere in the living room. While SO was chilling on his phone. I'm not happy, but I'm aware staying home with a small insane person all day can be exhausting. So i go to get the vacuum and clean up the mess. Crumbs were everywhere, including my SOs bag that was lying o.k. the floor. I vacuum the bag from the outside. Crumbs are also in the bag. I open the bag to vacuum inside and what do I find? A bud. I feel my shoulders tense up.

I look at the scene again. SO pretty damn relaxed, kid approaching sugar coma, taking the house apart, looking for attention from a grown-up. I get so angry that my ears start ringing. I call him irresponsible smoking while looking after the kid, I threaten to kick his stoner ass out into the street, the whole nine yards. He denies everything which pisses me off more.

It's a tiny piece of broccoli. BROCCOLI you guys. The dude went to the farmers market because I had said wanted to eat more healthy and bought unwrapped veggies. I apologized. A lot. He is pretty pissed. He is a good guy though, I'm pretty certain he will forgive me.

It was a simpler time. I was using our office's break-room refrigerator, and the only worry I had was the foot-stink of a particular colleague's collection of cheeses. They were kept in the crisper, but their odors persisted, indifferent to thin plastic barriers. 

I had complained to her, and she had bought a box of baking soda for the fridge. Okay, it was a nice try, but her cheeses proved too stinky. To me alone, it would turn out. 

After the baking soda was brought in, my shadow campaign to remove all cheeses from the community refrigerator lost popular support with the staff. I was left with no choice, I would show her, I would show them all... how stinky those cheese really were. 

It came to me from a trick that was popular with my fellows back in college. It works like this: When you need to fart, you simply pull down your pants, position your ass over the face of a passed-out roommate, insert a straw (preferably a flexible, narrow tube) into the mouth of said sleeping roommate, remember you must do this first, and \*then\* you insert the other end of the straw/tube into your fart-ready anus. This procedure will allow you to install your fart directly into your roommate's mouth with ease. 

How to employ this technique on cheese? She had a bag of shredded cheddar with a resealable top that would function very well as a mouth.

Late of a Tuesday night, when I was working over, I walked into the break room to grab a pudding cup from the fridge and it just so happened that I needed to relieve myself of a buildup of gaseous waste. 

Into that bag of cheddar did I then insert a straw, and onto that straw did I then set my anus. Into that bag I did then fart. 

I sealed the bag quickly and laughed hysterically for way too long. I didn't get anything else done that night.

At this point I'll should tell you that I didn't really expect her to notice. On Wednesday, I laughed at odd moments when I was alone and the thought crossed my mind. On Thursday, I only laughed when I opened the fridge and the cheese-stink reminded me of it. It was over, as far as I was concerned.

Today though, she was in the breakroom making a salad on the counter. The bag of cheddar shreds was there. When she saw me enter, she laughed and said something like 'I was just thinking about you,"" and she grabbed the bag. She held it out to me and said:

""Smell this, it smells just like your office.""

Throwaway account: Before I post this and get shit, my girlfriend has not in any way been loyal to me. But that’s not the point of the story below so I left that part out. 

So some background. I am an 18 yo male, just graduated high school. Ever since 6th grade I’ve befriended and crushed on a cute blonde girl (L). L and I would listen to music together (Rolling Stones😉)  in class and text each other. She had a boyfriend but to me it was more than a friendship. 

I have expressed my feelings to L multiple times over the years. To no avail. She stayed my BEST friend though no matter how hard I tried. Always by my side, always there to talk. She was becoming the love of my life and she didn’t even know it. 

Growing up I didn’t have the best home life. Constantly around drugs, mom was nodded out every night off xans, shit to that extent. Ls home life wasn’t too different. She was in a very toxic home with abuse of multiple kinds. She self harmed sometimes. I was always there the way she was there for me. 

Fast forward to the end of my junior year. L has a boyfriend (H) I find a new girl (P). The one that was missing. She came out of nowhere with unconditional love. The love was definitely there from the very beginning. 

P and I ended up getting arrested. We have been through a lot of crazy shit but we are still dating to this day. And going to the same college together. 

So recently L reached a breaking point with her home life that she called child services. She was 17 at the time. This was about a few months ago, and after she got help, she was thrown into foster care. 

Through this time I was texting her. She still is blatantly in love with H. We hadn’t talked in a long time but I knew she needed someone, and I know that H personally isn’t the one to relate to her mental issues on the level that I do. If you knew the extent of the abuse you would agree. I won’t lie, texting her again felt right. My best friend and I were close again. The love came rushing back. 
 

Fast forward to two days ago. She has been 18 for a few weeks now and has been given a rental home by the foster program. She tells me said news and I tell her I would like a tour of the small place. She said of course. 

Fast forward to tonight. My mom is in from South Dakota. Given my past with her, I did not want to see her. I was filled with rage and hurt and I wanted to leave. I start texting L as an escape. P isn’t near her phone, like always, so no answer from her. L tells me it will be okay and that she “needs help carrying groceries in anyways :)”

So I jump out of my seat and leave my family to go over there. I didn’t know what I expected from this 11PM visit but I knew it wasn’t right. I couldn’t stop myself regardless. I get to her house and she had just pulled in. I carry in her groceries with her and we put them away while laughing giggling and flirting almost as if we were husband and wife. 

There was a lot of bumping and eye contact. God the eye contact was electric. I knew she wanted me from the look in her eyes. 

It’s about 12:30 at this point and I’m still helping her with random housewarming shit to prolong my presence. I was literally sitting on her bed screwing in nails to put together a shoe rack for her. God I’m so whipped. She plops down next to me real close. Once I finish the show rack we turn off all the lights in the house because she “wants to show me her nightlights”. 

So I’m like okay, and we do this flirty thing afterward in bed for about 20 minutes where I rub her ass and back, until she finally let me take her sweatpants off. At the point her shirt was already off and she was in a bra. 

So I start fingering her while she’s on her stomach over her underwear. She’s dripping. 

I give her head, and holy shit it was better than classic rock on acid. She was so rough with it and she shoved my face in and her moans. 

She cums in a twitchy moany motion and then I head back up and put my dick in. It was amazing

I’m ready to leave P and everything she’s done to hurt me, but I don’t know if L is in the same boat. I genuinely love this girl and I feel like I’m being pulled in every direction.

throwaayTifu,bjz329,"So, I’m a 17 year old and like most 17 year olds, I like to jerk off 
I’ve been jerking off for about a year and when I jerked off, I got little cum, I was well into puberty so I thought something was wrong with me and I was impotent.
I jerked off real fast like 2-4 min tops I had heard that different people climaxed at different times and thought nothing of it.

Keep in mind that I live in a country where talk about sex is extremely taboo and I don’t think my parents will even give me “the Talk” . So, I didn’t tell anyone but I thought I was truly impotent and would never find a SO(I was an idiot, sex is not everything in a relationship)

Recently one night, my parent were fast asleep, I felt brave and snuck into the bathroom and this time, I don’t know why, I decided to take my time and jerk for at least 1/2 an hour. To my surprise, a huge amount of cum came out.

This caught me off guard so, another night, I decided to try again and again, I came a lot. It was at that point I realised I wasn’t impotent, I just sucked at jerking off.

SmellOfKibble,bjlnot,"Throwaway account because even though I see it as being very comedic I don't want this with me for the rest of eternity

So for some background me and my girlfriend constantly qoute memes on autopilot when we're in calls or hanging out with each other. In this case it was a stupid Tik Tok meme with the line ""Are you sure you wanna do this little girl?"". Now, you may already start to see where this is going but trust me, it  gets worse than that. So me and her have also recently been playing a lot of Smash Bros Ultimate together and I kept saying a sligthly twisted version of this line everytime she played a kid-looking character, just as a funny taunt I guess you could say.  We had been in a kind of a giggly mood before this, we're never super serious with each other and just try to make each other laugh for the most part. So as I'm unwrapping the condom I just ask her ""Are you sure you wanna do this?"" because she had been strongly hinting at it but I didn't quite know if she was in the mood or not and I always like to be sure. She responds with ""Yeah!"" and then the line just pops into my head and as usual I don't even think before I say it out loud.

""Are you sure you wanna do this little kid?""

She immediately bursts into laughter and I stand still for a few seconds, half thinking about what I just said and half not knowing if I should feel embarassed or just laugh along with her. But after awhile I give in and start laughing with her but try to contain myself a bit as to not completely ruin the mood. Of course we both get way too distracted for that to not happen and she gets filled with the realization that her boyfriend is a closet pedophile?

 Thankfully we both find it way too funny to get upset over it ruining the mood and we hug it out while we both continue to laugh sporadically.

TL;DR I keep qouting my own version of the ""Are you sure wanna do this little girl?"" meme when me and my girlfirend play Smash together. End up saying ""Are you sure you wanna do this little kid?"" to her before we're about to have sex.

symbolicsloth,ajtz10,"As all and as all have been noted, this didn't happen today (except for the assholes that actually have things bad happen to them then have the snarky idea to post their karma porn.)


This happened when I was 8. I had went to see a friend, who was living part-time with his grandmother. The nicest old lady, and as I'd been there before I can say the poodle was also very nice.


Anyway this is a short story. I knocked on the door, the sweet grandmother opens it for me and beckons my friend to come play. I use the term ""beckons"" as it wasn't something I was familiar with until later in life. My family are jerks. Anyway the sweet little puffy white miniature poodle comes running to me, I'm a dumb 8 year old and hold my hand out assuming that's the way to allow a dog to smell me before attempting to pet.


My arm was there and the dog decided that I was a jerk. The dog had intuition, ok. It bit me in the arm, totally deserved, and the grandmother kind of freaked out.


A few things to understand her fear. My father was the chief of police, it was a small town so everyone knew that dog ran free, and if there were 'classes' of people in this town, we were on opposite sides of that spectrum as well. Although 19k a year as a police officer still feels funny to me.


So grandma nice drops everything and rushes me to the hospital. Once we're there in the waiting room, she calls my dad to let him know.


Now I'm no rocket scientist. It has taken over or under 25 years for me to understand that the tetanus shot I was given was not the rabies shots that my dad would have insisted on. I am a murderer as well as a jerk.


tldr; I'm a good at nothing, and killed one of the cuter dogs that I've ever known while breaking the heart of nice grandma.


I encourage your hate to crave my own disgust in myself.

Suddenly, my puberty driven brain was having none of it and decided to make me horny. Naturally, I excused myself from the table and pretended to go to the bathroom upstairs. When I was finally up there, I opened my phone to look at some forbidden eye candies. I was sitting in the hallway and hesitated between relieving myself there or my aunt's room. I decided to go to my aunt's room due to fear that there might be some cameras in thw hallway. So I went on my aunt's bed and decided to polish my steel for a bit. After I was done, ironically, I was shocked to discover that there IS a camera right there, in that room! So I rushed downstairs and asked my aunt if I could have her phone to check if there was an app that she uses to monitor that camera. Unfortunately, that app is LOCKED and I couldn't access it.... the worse part is, my aunt is kinda curious about my sex life and sometimes joke about it... so this will not end well for me...

Tonight was pork chops so I got out the blueberry and ghost pepper sauce along with the ole Carolina reaper. The blueberry does give pork a good flavor by the way, but the reaper is just so naturally sweet it's my go to. I would cut a piece of meat and smother it in blueberry ghost pepper or dab it in the Carolina reaper.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with spicy stuff, Carolina reaper peppers register around 2 million SHU, and depending on the brand of hot sauce you can have anywhere from 250,000 to 2 million SHU hot sauce. What I used is around 1 million SHU, and if I do more than just a dab then I sweat profusely and nose runs. I've learned the right amount of sauce to use for me to tolerate it, but apparently it sticks around longer than I realized. My tongue will stay numb for the rest of the night after eating it, as it is now.

Well after supper, things got hot and heavy and I did the deed of going downtown for my wife. Afterwards, she immediately starts complaining of burning sensation on everything down there and I don't think anything of it.

ssarikaya,b45t1m,"The weekend of my 21st. Not only have I never had a legal drink but I’ve never had any form of alcohol ever. I find the drinking age arbitrary, but was never curious about it. I asked a few of my friends if they wanted to go to a classy bar but on our way there we found out it was closed.

We ended up going to a trashy club and the drinking commenced. I let my friends choose all my drinks. First, cranberry vodka. Didn’t feel anything, told my friends, they gave me one of theirs and I finished that too. Still nothing. They bought me vodka with orange juice, just as gross and still nothing. My boyfriend says if I really want to feel something I need SHOTS. So he gets me a shot of tequila. I down it and then another. They tell me maybe I should stop even though I feel nothing but I drink one more version of vodka before I’m through.

I’m 5’1” around 105 pounds and at this point, wasted. It was around midnight and the last time I ate was late lunch. I haven’t had water since 10 maybe, before we went out. The only thing running through my system is alcohol. 

I bounce around at the club, definitely feeling it and then feeling it way too much and start to get nauseous. We make our way back and my boyfriend and I are feeling frisky. 

We start undressing and then I remember I’m on my period. I don’t usually feel up to it when I’m shedding the lining of an entire organ but drunk me was down. My boyfriend asks me if I’m sure and I say yeah yeah and we go at it. Neither of us say anything but I can’t stand it. only a few minutes in and I tell him I feel like I’m on fire. He says his dick is stinging too. My butt cheeks, the front of my thighs, my vagina feel like they’re burning.

Of course we ignore it at first and try to fight through like the horny heroes we are but we have to stop again because neither of us are enjoying it anymore. I feel like my lower body is being dropped into a deep fryer. 

We hurry to get a hold of some wet wipes or anything to try to get whatever is on us off. We’re super drunk so we aren’t really thinking straight and I even think that maybe I spilled alcohol over my legs and the sex activated a chemical that’s irritating me now. My boyfriend is a little smarter than me and he looks it up.

Apparently when you’ve drunk enough, the pH of your blood becomes very acidic, especially if you haven’t had any water or eaten recently. My lovely period blood was giving us acid burns. 

We both washed up, but unfortunately our legs and crotch kept burning until mid-next day.

TLDR; I drank so much that my blood pH became acidic and that blood got all over my boyfriend and me when we had period sex and we had mild acid burns until the next day

Edit: apparently there’s no way my blood pH got that low, must’ve been something else, but that explanation was good enough for us then and haven’t looked into it since.

I have this urge to learn more and I want to feel the excitement like when I typed my first basic program on a computer when I was six years old, I was a smart child.

Childhood should be a good time but at the time you have nothing to compare with so a lot of the time is a letdown because you want more of the better times and although a year feels like a decade, before you have time to be thankful its gone for ever!

I will repeat that time goes quickly and before you know it your 15 with the knowledge that is wasted on youth you know nothing except fear and to certain extent this is normal but after being diagnosed with Epilepsy, your once quick to react mind becomes null to the various things happening that pass you by, you grow angry with the world that at best is patronizing or at worst is attacking you and no one understands, your future plans, (even the silly ones children have that are unrealistic that are made to be broken and replaced) are gone, any aspirations you had are worthless because your ability to recall information is not there.

Heading into your 20s you try various things to get by trying to fit in has a nobody, your not even The Brain anymore that one attribute is long gone! your nothing, the technique that I will say chose me, is denial because you tell yourself one day you will wake up and it will be just a nightmare and each time you reach a low, this will be the last storm before the calm, needless to say self loathing becomes a positive because it will culminate with a low or maybe stress induced seizure and not waking up.

The smells the taste of youth that give that spark are gone like they were never there and by your mid 20s your cold inside that feels nothing, leaves you playing to the gallery because your too much of a coward to put a stop to the pretense of just moving through the motions. These times force you to become an actor and play the character you think you should be! try and please everyone but in the end please no one, your a fake, part of you realizes this and tries to create a structure to adhere to, this is achieved by becoming altruistic and living in the past, reverting back to childhood expectations of fairness.

30 like every few years before, things will be different after all life begins at 30! even though you know its just another day the difference being there is a card on the mantle piece. Well now you remember something from you childhood, fear of death. no its the same dread you had when you learn that life is not infinite but you have not feared death for a long time in fact you rationalize it well and quite regularly wish for it.

But you start to fear, not ever being important enough to leave any lasting impression on a single sole, you envy people who have friends and family who cared, knowing when your turn comes you will have nobody to mourn your passing. Your ashamed that you allowed a non physical problem to effect your life, you are selfish, think of all those people who have not got the opportunities for life, I mean all I need to do is take a few simple tablets! which is true but the tablet has side effects of making you tired, melancholy and decreases you thought and memory ability further.

The feeling of a grand mall seizure is the same feeling if you have ever had a good beating, not a slap, I mean a good kicking! then add having a bad hang over after 3 hours sleep without the headache, then taking the hair of the dog about half a bottle of whisky just before you take a math exam the only difference being the exam is life.

Suddenly i had this urge to do it one day and i looked at some stuff and was ready to beat my meat.

I started and about 10min in without any lube or stuff on it, it was red hot already, then i applied some waster(got no lube or creams) and my meat didn’t give up even after 15min. I kept going on and on by changing positions up and down. I couldn’t concentrate because of the meds( which i learnt later) no matter what and it took me a while to imagine different stuff to cum and by that time my penis got ruptured and I didn’t feel a thing until i lost my erection.

Some nerves got ruptured and my penis got bubble like bulge on my foreskin and it was red. It turned into a blobfish and had to rush to ER nurses and docs had funny laughs and said its going to fix itself  in a day or two and they said I don’t have to worry much and stop fapping hard .

DaBurnerAccount1,b3oosk,"I posted this in r/sex a few min ago, I just thought like it could fit in this thread as well. (Partly because I like these stories on this thread personally)

So let me start off by giving some background to the situation.  I'm in college, and I have a female friend with benefits (I'm a male and shes a female) and I often will go over there after my classes on wednesdays, to either hang, get nasty, or both. Today, was both. 

So here we are. Around 10pm, at her apartment (a one bedroom apartment its literally just is two) and we are just casually hanging out watching TV, just chatting. She had mentioned to me in a text or something a few days prior to this happening (this happened last night) saying she was on her period, but it had been about 4 days, and so being kinda ignorant,  I thought she would be off of it, or super close to being done with it.

Side note: I've only period sex before with an ex, and her flow was light to the point where it didn't even bother me if we fucked on her period because we used condoms, and the blood was pretty much minimal and it was only on the condom, so I've done this twice before in my life, with her.

Back to the story; we are hanging out watching TV and whatnot, and I mention I should leave in about a half hour which would put me around 10:45ish so I could drive back to my place and try to get some sleep as I have a test the next day.

She agrees, and confirms that's fine, and then proceeds to come and kiss me. I dont stop myself, and now it appears I'll probably get some before I go. So she stops me, and says ""look, I'm still on my period, but I shouldn't have anything left as I'm near the end, and if we just pull off the sheets a tad, we can fuck, and you dont even have to finger me to get me going"" so because I've had period sex before, and assumed it would be hardly any blood, I agreed, we pulled the oversized sheets off the terrible dorm mattress and started stripping

We had all the lights off in the room, as I was going to grab a condom off her makeup desk where we keep them, and i hit the light switch, to her request. I lay back down, and shes giving me head, and then she comes up and says she wants to fuck. I grab my condom, put it on, and she climbs on me. 

I should've asked to do missionary because of the situation, but hey, I wasn't gonna say no to her riding me cowgirl. So she climbs on me, we fuck for probably around 15 min if I had to guess, and then I finish, she leans forward, and I pull my dick out. She says immediately that i dont have to help her finish (cause if i finish and she didn't, I will help usually) so I said cool, and got up to go clean up. This is where regret steps in. I walk into the bathroom, and see how much blood was caked onto the condom, my balls, crotch, and pretty much the surrounding area. I WAS MORTIFIED. I grabbed some paper towels off of the counter, and pulled the condom off, and begin to wipe down my dick, crotch, and balls. I went through a good amount, and got to the point where I looked for some wet wipes. Found some, and used those instead

THE SMELL WAS UNBEARABLE. I was to the point where I literally was gagging, and was almost gonna throw up because of how bad it smelled. It already looked like a gallon of blood was on my crotch, now it smells like a super strong, piercing smell. I can't even describe it tbh. I cleaned up, came out, got my stuff and left. She was cool and happy, but man, after smelling that, and seeing the amount of blood she had on ""day 4"", I'll never be having period sex again.

And I can't get this smell out of my head. I showered and everything when I got home. I dont physically smell it anymore but it's one if those smells where you can smell it in your head if you think about it, of that makes any sense. Like thinking of driving past a skunk on the road and smelling it in your head (Terrible example I know)

So I'm using alt for reasons.

It isn't that major, but its the people I live in my own house with.

Today, I was super bored. Like I haven't done anything these last couple days bored.

I decide to look on twitch, look on irl streams and accidentally misclick. Grown ass woman in suggestive content.

I'm such a dumbass. You and I know.

I then hear a yell ""Get off  that \[anon\], it'll turn into a habit.""

yr1009,91hnxw,"TLDR- came home from clg stressed, had a fight on call with father, attempts to fix keyboard, ended up destroying. Needed to do urgent payment so with the help of on screen keyboard i managed to get the payment page, internet was giving hiccups, tried to flash newer firmware of modem, destroyed it.

-----
This happened today.
So, i came home very stressed from college as professor had given us very large assignments that had to be submitted and checked by tomorrow so my mood was down. I then had some lunch and got a call from my father to enquire about some Glass(home is under renovation, so had to negotiate the prices with glass suppliers) , i told him it would take me about and hour and didn't have time for that, would do it tomorrow, he was really upset about that because of my tone, our family has anger issues, so he got angry, i got angry and we had some back and forth wordings. I hung up! Immediately after, my uncle WhatsApped me and told me to pay the mobile bill and it was urgent as he wasn't able to make calls. I fired up my pc, and notice that the shift key on my keyboard was fixed and my windows password has numbers in it. And in no way i could enter those. The numpad worked as arrowkeys when used with shift pressed and the keys above 'qwerty' just speller out symbols![goodbye old friend](https://i.imgur.com/lxJehOQ.jpg)☹️☹️ But, i did managed to log in with the help of On screen keyboard and after logging in, i noticed one more thing, that the internet was gibberish, it gave full bandwidth on speef test, but would take so much time to load some pages, I did the usual (clear cache, history..) but that didnt helped, i knew that a firmware was available at the manufacturer site dated 1.11, i had 1.10, thought it could fix it, tried flashing which i had never done, and then the power light turned red, the only other light was 'i' which was yellow looked like  [this](https://i.imgur.com/YMFFJmm.jpg)   . I searched online, they told me to go into recovery mode and reflash the firmware, now i tried so hard did everything and the modem still wont go into recovery. So this happened, now i am stuck with no unlimited internet for few weeks. I dont earn so now i have to say enough (₹20 per day to make upto ₹1000 for modem+router combo and ₹300-400 for a keyboard). I get ₹30 daily for college in which ₹5-₹5 is for auto(tuk-tuk) and ₹20 for snacks, if i am dedicated enough i can save each(college going day) ₹20 and in some cases even ₹30. So i did the maths , i have to save for atleast a month for the internet itself 😅 and some more days for the keyboard, till then there would be no(little) PC or unlimited internet.  
I cant even ask my father for money because of my ego and how i behaved today!!

moral -  never get angry with father, as bad karma starts!!

PS- if anyone reading has some knowledge and can help me in fixing this affordably, i would appreciate a lot. The model number of keyboard is Microsoft Wireless 800 and for model+router is Dlink wireless 2730u. Any help would be appreciated so please DM.

Dark_Shade_75,btt9pt,"So today was fun. And yes, actually today.

So, there was this sweet innocent cat that was found a couple weeks ago near my gf’s veterinary hospital. Decent health but some coughing/sneezing, no chip. No luck finding an owner. I found out they were going to have to euthanize the poor thing. I told my girl there was no way in hell I was letting that happen. I told her that even though I’d get in a ton of trouble if I adopted him, if they couldn’t find someone
willing to, I’d take him in to make sure he wasn’t put down.

Fast forward to this morning. I wake up with her and she tells me to call the vets. I say sure, I’ll get to it in an hour or so.

You can guess where this is going. I make the call about an hour later. The girl I get takes my info down and tells me she’ll call me back when she gets some information on the cat. My girl goes to work, and calls me later telling me the cat was euthanised minutes before my call. Apparently the hospital’s doctor, who had performed it, needed to take a break when he found out I had called slightly too late.

I’m broken at this point. My girl calls me over and over again to make sure I’m okay, but I ignore every single call cuz I just want to be alone like an ass. Figured I deserved to wallow, so I piss her off in the process. I decide hey, I’ll watch a movie to cheer me up. I go to see Endgame since I hadn’t had much free time to before now. No spoilers for those who haven’t seen it, but it wasn’t a good plan.

I drive home. Part breaks off of my car’s exhaust, leaving it dangling and bouncing. I jerry rig it with bungie cord. I have work tomorrow and now I have to hope my car can make it because I won’t have time to get it fixed until Wednesday.

Now I sit in a parking lot, broken car, broken heart, waiting for a reply from the love of my life.

Fun day.


TL;DR: I waited just slightly too long to call the vets to save a cat. Wallowed in misery and angered the love of my life. Watched a sad movie. Car broke on the way home. Ending the day with sitting alone in a parking lot hoping I can make it back and to work tomorrow.",tifu,TIFU by killing a cat
thefucking_master,bpo556,"This happened yesterday morning and I'm still scarred. 

I'd like to start by clarifying that I'm a straight male. Like really straight. So we have just one bedroom in our house, and everyone usually changes in there. There's three people in the house. Me and my parents. Obviously, we lock the door before changing.

This fine morning, my dad decides that he doesn't need to lock the door. My phone was kept inside that room so I walk in to get it. I was barefoot so I didn't make much noise while doing so. I pick up my phone, and turn to the right. 

I see my father standing there and with a swift motion, he takes off his underwear. Obviously he didn't know I was standing there behind him. THANKFULLY, he wasn't facing me so I only got a flash of his buttocks. I'd seen dad butts in Indian porn before, and I have to give it to him, he'd maintained them very well. Smooth, shiny, hairless and round. 

I'm not fantasizing, these are just my observations.

So anyway, the moment he slid his undies down, I was scarred and didn't know what to do. So instinctively, I uttered a loud ""HMMMM"". Like the angry one. He quickly turns around and I get a full frontal (he thought I was my mom). He sees that it's me and covers his nest with his shorts.

But I'd seen enough. 

Flash forward to this morning, when I was wanking one off to some good old lesbian porn. I was just about to cum when there was a sudden flash inside my head. I don't know why brains do this but yes, you guessed right, it was of my naked father. Just like that, my erection was gone and I was left sitting with a limp dick in my hands.

I just can't get that image out of my head and I don't know when I'll be able to werk one off without that picture popping up inside my head.

Stickiey_,bg27jc,"Some context:
My parents are strict, not really bad, but they make me go to bed at nine and I can’t play video games during the week. About a month ago I was allowed to move my PS4 to my room, a BIG first. Because of this my mom always thinks I stay up late playing video games, but jokes on her I watch YouTube or Anime on my phone. 

Now on to the story

I go for my usual YouTube/Anime binge Sunday night, my brightness is all the way up because I don’t care. Then all of the sudden my mom barges in.

Mom: Stickiey_ *middle name, last name* what the f#$k are you doing!?!

Me, knowing that if I were to tell her that I was watching YouTube she would take my phone: P..PORN!

Mom: seriously, what were you doing?

Mom: *closes door*

Later I found out that she barged into my room because she saw a light under my door and thought it was me playing video games.

Drummingknifes,b61pp0,"A bit of a NSFW but here it goes.

Mandatory this happened about 10 years ago. 

So I was talking to a girl online at this random website, we hit it off as she seems nice although a bit clingy. Didn't think much of it as I was young (around 18 years old) and agreed on a date. We had probably spoken for about a week now up to this point. 

She lived in a small town about 2 hours away from the city where I live. We had agreed to meet downtown so she grabbed a bus that took her to the city and then took a trip through the subway to reach the spot we had agreed.

I show up in time, she was already there (probably 10 minutes earlier than me) she runs up to me and kisses me without warning, I roll with it because I was young and you know, #YOLO.

We start walking, she keeps telling me how happy she is that we finally met. She's playful, overly cheerful and tries to run away from me expecting me to chase her. I hesitate because she's acting a bit too childish for my taste.

As we're walking we pass through a motel (one of those cheap hotels that you usually go to to have sexy times), she turns to me and says ""Wanna change our original date?"" horny, stupid and young me accepts and we go inside the place.

We get a cheap but nice looking room that had a Jacuzzi. I'm super pumped because I'm about to get laid with literally no effort from my end and she's all into it.

We undress ourselves, she's shy about taking her underwear off so I reassure her that it's going to be fine as I take the remaining clothes she has on.

She proceeds to throw me in bed with a sexy attitude, she's brimming with confidence and the blowjob commences, but then I feel something that would turn this date into a 180 of hell. 

IT HURTS.

It feels like she's gnawing a bit on my penis. It's not an unbearable pain but it definitely does not feel like a BJ should feel! 
I am holding back from stopping her because I thought it would be super rude but whatever she was doing down there was making me feel super uncomfortable. She's super into it, she's moaning over it and telling me how big I am (I'm really not, no need to sugarcoat it) and deepthroating that thing like a wannabe pro.

I stop her after about 2 minutes or so without saying anything and I just turn her over and go to town on her. ""This should be better right? No more weird painful blowjob and she's gonna love it"" I thought to myself.

But what's this? IT REEKS. SERIOUSLY. You've ever walked by a sea food market where people have fish and stuff on display? That's as close as I can describe it. Me being a (horny) gentleman power though it and do my best.

I am about 20 seconds in and this girl starts moaning as hard as the girl from the exorcist movie when she's floating above her bed trying to fight the holy water. She is completely exaggerating her reaction and is moaning her lungs out.

I give up on it about 1 minute later as I can't stand neither the smell or her overly exaggerated reaction. She seems pleased and ready for the main event. I go in missionary style and then the shit REALLY hit the fan.

As a (fairly) unexperienced young man, I go in but there's something weird about it. It definitely didn't feel like my previous experiences. 

She is as TIGHT as it can get, even though she's super into it. I figure that the lack of proper foreplay is messing with us so I ask her if she's okay and good to go. She replies with a moany ""Yess give it to me baby"". So I grab my shaft and do my best to get inside. I'm able to get just the tip and SHE IS GOING CRAZY OVER IT. She's acting like she's about to orgasm or something, I keep pushing in unable to get more of me inside her. This is clearly enough for her as she's acting like she's in heaven. 

This goes on for about 2 more minutes, and then I think to myself ""What if she's a virgin? Maybe that's why this is so tight and near impossible! But I thought that it was painful for women to lose their virginity so WTF is going on?!"" all while still trying to push myself in. She looks at me whilst moaning, rubs her hand across my naked chest, looked me right in eye and she said it:


I... I.. I LOVE YOU!

I froze. We've only been talking to each other for about a week, I'm calling upon the grace of the gods to figure out why the fuck is my penis having such a hard (hehe, get it?) time to do its job and you say this to me?! 
Seriously, it's like I'm in an anime cliche or something.

I unfroze, I don't respond and pretend I didn't hear it. I don't know what to do so I turned off my brain and let my 18 year old horny me instincts guide me and continued shoving myself unto her. She's cool and continues her exaggerated act.

As I'm trying to find an explanation as to what kind of bad decisions had led me to that exact time and place, I notice that my erection is wearing off. You see, when you grab an erect penis and constantly bash it against something that barely has an opening you'll eventually run out of stamina and sexual desires.

So I'm suuuuper ashamed by this point and I really don't want her to look at my John because I'd figure she would be super sad that I am not aroused anymore and she would blame herself.
So I ""pull out"" and pretend like I'm exhausted and  roll myself over to the other side of the bed, my back facing her. 

She's asks ""What's wrong? I reply ""nothing, you just really gave me a run for my money and I need to catch my breath"". She giggles and kisses my back. She said something along the lines of ""I really want a soda, it's pretty hot in here"". I immediately get up and offer to walk to the nearby store to get it for her as well as some other things. I needed to get out of there fast and think about what to do.

I put on my clothes and rush outside the motel, there's a 7-11 a few blocks away. I go in and buy some things along with some cigarettes. I light one up and sit by a bench for a minute figuring out what the hell just happened and what am I going to do when I get back.

I go back to her, I come up with some lame excuse about how its getting late and she lives really far away so we should go before the subway stops working. She agrees and we leave the place.

Fast forward to the subway, we're sitting next to each other, tired. She's leaning her head on my shoulder. She asks me ""Hey, about what I said, do you feel the same way?"" I could feel my ass clenching up. ""WTF am I supposed to say? If I don't tell her I love her back I'm gonna look like a douche that just used her for some (lame) sex on the first date!""

I told her the truth, I told her I didn't feel the same way and that she made me feel really insecure about some things. I apologized as I didn't want to look like the douche that used her for sex, but I'd rather be honest and hurt her feelings than fake it out and rip her heart out in the future when the truth came to light.

She started crying quietly, I apologized, I told her it was for the best. She said she understood. I told her we shouldn't see each other anymore and that I was sorry, as I was saying this we arrived at a station near a friend's house. I stood up and left just waving goodbye as the subway doors closed and she waved back.

I ran to my friends house and told him everything, he had a good laugh about it and offered me a beer to forget about the whole thing.

10/10 Would never have sex on the first date ever again.

TL;DR: I went out with a girl for the first time. She's too childish for me, date suddenly turns into a ""let's go have sex at this random motel"". Sex gets weird and painful, girl tells me she's in love with me mid sex, I lose my erection. I broke her heart before we reach her bus stop and ran away never seeing her again.

UnforgivingWife,artuss,"Obligatory this didnt happen today (it happened 2/13) but I'm still struggling with it today.

I like to surprise my husband with massages and it being Valentines day soon, I figured hed appreciate one. I was in a BST group on Facebook and someone recommended one that we hadnt used before and it was a running a Valentine's day special - so I thought, what the hey? 

Dropped him off at the parlor, me and our kids got dinner and then went to Chuck E Cheese to wait out the hour massage.

He arrives a little later and the first thing he says is ""Im gonna need a blow job tonight."" I smiled and said ""Was she sexy?"" (Im bi. I dont mind if he looks.) And he said no and then told me about that I signed him up for a massage where the goal was basically to give him a semi by rubbing as close to his cock without touching (except... When she did touch him) and then massage elsewhere to let him go flaccid. 

I'm stunned and don't quite know what to say. He then tells me about what she said when he got in there. ""Oh your wife signed you up for this? She must be pretty awesome."" ""Some guys have to relieve themselves in the middle of the procedure. Just let me know and Ill get you a towel.""

He goes along with it because he thinks its what I signed him up for. We have a good strong relationship, and theres a potential that I could have signed him up for it. We've been in polyamorous relationships in the past, we watch porn together.

We get home, he shows me the massages she performed and I pretend to be ok. He gets his blow job and goes to bed. I stay up thinking about it non stop. Eventually I tell him that Im not ok with what happened. That I want to be mad at him but I cant. He says he should have left. He says it was stupid to stay.

He should have left. He should have called. He should have texted. He should have asked. We have 2 kids under 3 yrs ols so sex is... Scarce. I feel like he didnt call me because secretly he wanted the massage... Whether I was ok with it or not. :(

Here it is almost a week later and I still cant stop thinking about it. I dont want to touch him because I cant stop thinking about her touching him. I usually give him massages and back rubs all the time... But I cant. I dont know what to do...

Context: So I have a crush on this girl from my class, we're friends, although I don't know if I'll be able to say the same when I get to school tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, after getting in bed I did my daily business, fully naked, no clothes on. It was about 11:45pm.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my phone and opened whatsapp, so that I could use my crush's profile pic as ""inspiration"". I click on her profile picture to maximize it and have a better view. Remember that when you have someone's pfp like that, there are four buttons under it, for calling, video calling, chatting and info.

Everything goes as normal, I finish doing my thing and grab a pair of dirty boxers I had laying next to me to clean myself up. All of this while in the dark of my bedroom, as my phone screen as the only light source.

As I can't see too well, I direct my phone at the ""cleaning area"" with my screen. Because I'm laid down, when I direct the screen towards me, my thumb is placed under the phone and on the screen, holding most of the weight.

My city is bipolar. In the summer, we can easily alternate between 65 degree days and 102 degree days. On one particular day on the high end of the spectrum, I was sitting in my boiling room trying to make it through the heat.

The pictures were ones I just googled that looked similar enough to me. I had to save them to my phone to send them in our chat. These were frontal nudes and vag pictures.

Well we all know when we hand someone a smartphone, whether they have prior experience or a smartphone of their own or not, they can't keep their hands on the bezel and inadvertently end up hitting the back button, which took him back to the gallery and my newly saved nude images, he hesitated and then handed it back to me and asked if I could put him back on the camera. I'm used to having to do this at **least** once in situations like this, so I thought nothing of it till I got my phone back and realized I was staring at open vag pictures right in my face.

I'm too afraid to broach the subject now to explain even though I have no problem with the explanation, it's just too awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I had random google nudes saved on my phone but they looked like me. On christmas my step father used my phone camera and accidentally went back to the gallery and saw them, nothing was said but I'm inclined to believe he thinks he saw his step daughters very raw nudes and I'm too afraid to correct it now.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Since people keep downvoting and thinking I'm being a dick and catfishing even though it makes no sense for me to post and do that. The short explanation was that we both were too shy to actually send nudes, so we agreed that finding pictures at least similar looking would work well enough and just never show the faces of the people so as not to ruin it, just body pics. Thanks for calling me a piece of shit though.  ",tifu,TIFU by letting my step father believe he saw my nudes
xCuri0,bgctrh,"So  I have this cracked Mi A1 that I haven't used since I bought a Poco F1.  So I was thinking of sticking my 3 inch wide and 6 inch long Mi A1 in  my ass for the past weeks. Today I decided to make it a reality so first  I installed eXtreme kernel to overclock the vibrator to stimulate my  prostate as much as possible. I also needed a lot of lube but I'm below  the legal age to buy it so I decided to use semen instead. I cummed 8  times watching smartphone r34 and had collected 30ml of semen within 8  hours (yes I know these are rookie numbers). I installed a vibrator app  on my Mi A1 and now its time to stick it in. I put all my semen up my  ass in order to lubricate it and slowly pushed the Mi A1 up my ass. I  felt a bit of pain for the extreme stretching since the largest object I  had previously stuck up my ass was a vibrating Nokia. Slowly I was  getting closely to the prostate and could feel the pleasure  intensifying. Then I hit the prostate. I fucking orgasmed 5 times within  20 seconds of it hitting and was cumming buckets. I felt waves of  pleasure travel all throughout my body. 2 minutes in and I have had more  than 20 orgasms (I have lost track). But then I start to feel a warm  sensation in my ass. With each second it keeps getting hotter and  hotter. THEN IT STARTS TO FUCKING BURN AS MY MI A1 FUCKING EXPLODES FROM  THE HUGE OVERCLOCKING. I run out of the bathroom naked passing my  parents to reach to my Poco F1 to call 911. I tell them that I stuck a  Mi A1 in my ass and it exploded and I can't remove it since its so hot  and deep inside. Blood is all over the floor from the intense bleeding  and I feel like I am going to pass out. Then I hear the ambulance  coming. They lift me into the back of it and I'm now being rushed to the  hospital. In the back of the ambulance they manage to extract the Mi A1  which was covered in blood and feces. After 5 minutes of intense pain I  am finally at the hospital and they give me intense painkillers. Then  they tell me that I cannot shit for the next 6 months and I have to use a  colostomy bag. All because of sticking this Mi A1 in my ass

If you ask me would I do it again I would say yes. It was completely worth it

This incident happened 8 months ago in August and I am completely recovered now. Though I do have PTSD whenever I see a Mi A1

So I'm sitting there, right, barbecue sauce on my titties. It's almost 7am and I can't sleep because my brain thinks that melatonin is a government myth. My gf just got off her night shift and seeing that I'm awake, wants to hang out. Despite my throbbing headache I let her into my house. We're shooting the shit when one nudge leads to another and soon enough God sees what is happening out of the corner of his eye and regrets giving humans another chance. I find the perfect position for her and it's on. After about 15 minutes in I stop exhausted, having not finished. She on the other hand admits to loosing track after the 4th orgasm. It is soon apparent that she has no interest in how it felt for me and I just accept the incoming blue balls. Wonderful. She rolls over me to grab her phone on the nightstand while I'm trying to put some damn clothes on because someone pushed all the bed sheets onto the floor. I sit up and turn to her, but she has her back to me and is on her phone. Curious, I lean over her shoulder and see her open the messenger app to reveal multiple messages from a coworker all including some very out of the box ways of saying my gf is a straight banger visually and in bed. My gf, the quick thinker she is, has responds equally to every one of these messages with even more over the top replies. She quickly flips to her contacts and messages an old high school friend who she wants to hang out with later apparently, none the wiser that I just saw who her new boy toy is and what he likes to do with his dick. She gets dressed and my shivering ass walks her to my front door where she says in the most fake tone known to man that she's sorry I didn't finish but oh well maybe next time. I finally get her out the door and close it while locking the deadbolt in one fell swoop. As I'm standing in my entry way trying to figure out what the fuck just happened, the tip of my dick decides it want to play charades and mimics the bites of 15 fire ants. As of writing this it has stepped up its game and is now mimicking the bites of 25 fire ants.

SpoonyLizard,9bbbeh,"Some context: I'm a 19 year old girl who's never been in a relationship, and before this story took place had never been on a date, or done anything past making out. I'm quite shy and awkward so Tinder seemed like a great idea.


This story takes place on the 7th of May. I'd been talking to Christopher, who's 20, for a week at this point. We meet at a public place, and within the first 30 seconds of meeting I realise I'm not into Christopher. He stopped about 10 metres in front of me to light a cigarette and just stood there smoking it, without acknowledging me, and when I walked over to him to introduce myself and he spoke back, I realised that I hated his voice and struggled to understand him. He was 25 minutes late and I later found out that it was because his takeaway was late. 


I didn't want to just go straight home so I decided I'd give him a chance. We went to a few pubs and got quite drunk. I found him quite interesting as he had his unique quirks, e.g. the only alcohol he would drink was Guinness and he only listened to older acoustic rock. Our 4th pub of the night was Cassidy's, a popular student pub which I'd never been to before. Bear in mind we were both pretty drunk at this point.


Cassidy's has a seating area outside the pub and Christopher and I sat there. I left my bag with Christopher and went inside to get us both drinks. I came back and noticed that my bag wasn't on the table. ""Where's my bag?"", I asked. ""Oh, I was talking to this man and he must have took it without me noticing"". Great. He went inside to confront the man but after a few minutes he hadn't come out so I went into the pub. I see Christopher talking to this man, a 30-something American tourist. I noticed my bag was behind the man so I reached behind him to grab it. The man pulled back, and did it a couple more times before I could snatch it off him. 


Even though I'd already taken the bag off him, the main thing on my mind was ""I should teach him a lesson"", so of course I punched him in the face. This was very out of character for me and I instantly regretted it. ""No violence"" I hear the bartender say as she brings Christopher and I outside. I don't think they noticed that the guy had stolen my bag as nothing happened to him.


Outside I'm talking to Christopher and noticing the time. It's about 10 minutes to the last bus and it's about a 7 minute walk to the bus stop , but I'm drunk so it might take longer. Christopher tells me that it costs about €10 to get a taxi to his place (a taxi home would cost me €40), so I agree to go there, with no intentions of hooking up (there was no flirting during our date). We get to his place and within seconds of getting into bed we start making out and things progressed from there, with no condom (bad decision and have used protection always since then). 


That's the main story but there's some more details.

The morning after, we're cuddling, extremely hungover, and he puts a hand on my foot and just holds it. I was too weirded out to say anything. He goes downstairs to get breakfast (his parents don't know I'm here), and I hear his mother call out ""Sam"". I confront Christopher and he tells me his name is in fact Sam (but when I ask, he doesn't tell me which one he prefers). 


I agreed to a second date, although I'm not really sure why, I guess because I thought he was interesting, even though I wasn't into him. It was an okay at best date. At one point we were in a cafe drinking tea and he takes out this book that he tells me he wrote himself. He then proceeds to read a chapter of it, quietly, completely ignoring me. After at least 5 minutes he then shows me a paragraph which consisted of him poorly attempting to write philosophically about fruit. 


Weeks later I get a message on Tinder from Christopher saying ""Hey I think you're cute but I don't think we're suited to a relationship"" and I'm thinking thank fuck. We talk a bit more and then he says ""If you want to be friends or even just fuck again let me know"". I replied ""Gonna be completely honest, there will be no more fucking but I'm down for being friends"" and he says ""haha no more fucking well I'll just unmatch you on this since I have you on WhatsApp"". We talked for a few minutes on WhatsApp before he ghosted me. 


I went to Cassidy's a few days after the first date and the bartender said ""Sorry but due to an incident that happened last week we're not going to serve you"". I've a distinctive hair colour so I haven't been back yet to see if I'm un-banned. 

I've a good few more weird experiences from Tinder that I might share depending on the popularity of this post.

WellDadImlost,a9vwrj,"Back in my Senior year of High school (2016)  myself and my fairly recent girlfriend  at the time (my now wife!) went to a local NY style pizza place neither one of us had been to. Now it’s worth mentioning at this time my eyesight wasn’t exactly stellar and I didn’t have glasses I just sort of accepted it and lived on. So we walk into the Pizzeria and they have their menu hung behind the counter on the wall, I can barely make out what the pizzas are made of let alone their names! And of course I wasn’t going to ask what the names or ingredients were I was too cool for that in my mind. But nonetheless I decided on a pizza which to me sounded quite odd for a pizza but I just figured that’s what it was “GRANDMA SADDLE” I wasn’t going to question it I just shrugged it off. We make it to the Cashier and I confidently say aloud “yeah can we get one Grandma Saddle please”  and the Cashier looks at me with such bewilderment  and shock while my Girlfriend is laughing at me! The Cashier trying to hold off laughs says “heh do you mean a Grandma Sadie?” Trying not to die of embarrassment I relied with “yeah that sounds sooooooooooo much better!” 
I will say that it was a good pizza and a memorable one for sure, with a “thin crust Sicilian style with basil, mozzarella cheese 
Fresh marinara, oregano, &amp; parmesan” (pulled from their website today) 
So if any of you get a Hankering for a Grandma Sadie go for it! Or a Grandma Saddle if that’s what you want, whatever you’re into!

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a helluva a week . . . AND it's only Tuesday!

I've been diagnosed with some DNA gene mutations that make it very likely  I will develop ovarian and/or breast cancer (both of which my mother has had). This has led to a rash of doctors appointments to determine a course of action.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this week, I needed to have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at my one remaining ovary; AND I was to have a blood sugar test, so I was to be fasting. My guy awoke horny, but I nixed fucking (due to said ultrasound) but then insisted I would swallow!. YUM &amp; OOPS!  (That's not fasting!) A minute after said deed, we both broke out laughing. Guess that blood test would need to be postponed!

Not completely sure, though, I am coy with the phlebotomist, and admit I've had a ""sip"" of something that morning. He's not concerned, and we proceed. Whatever, we've all gotten past anything embarrassing. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I show up at the gynecological oncologist who specializes in ovarian cancer only to find I'll have a full on (UNEXPECCTED) exam. Needless to say partner and I had fabulous sex before the appt. Damn! There may have been unexpected liquids in there!

These poor doctors! On one level, I want to apologize. On another, I don't (can't). I need my sex life. Everything they are trying to predict will eliminate it.

Sorry, not sorry.

My girlfriend and I were walking to the polling booth to vote in out national election and a car was turning into the street we were about to cross.

So I said to my girlfriend ""It's not a woman, it's just a man who looks a bit like a woman"". I look up and there's a trans woman handing out 'how to vote' flyers right in front of me, looking offended. I didn't connect the dots and just smiled at her and kept walking.

I then realised that she must have thought I was talking about her, but by then I'd walked down the street a bit, so I couldn't run back and explain myself.

Throwaway890898,bou0yg,"Well this didn't actually happen today but it has come to a conclusion that started because of that threesome probably.

My GF and I always had a very active and creative sexual relation, we enjoyed doing kinky stuff and talking dirty, we even fantasized about other guys having sex with her and me watching, well one day we where at the bar, my GF was teasing me with her revealing dress and a guy noticed what we where doing, we didn't care much but after a some drinks my GF told me the guy wouldn't stop looking at her and I jokingly told her to tease him too, this guy decided to come to our table and we ended up having our first threesome.

We really liked it and the next day we started talking about it, we wanted to do it again, we set some rules and made sure we both where ok with it.

So this was about four months ago, in that time we have been going to bars and night clubs to find guys, we even have a tinder account to look for attractive guys.

After we thought that we spammed enough, we stopped. 5 mins later a kid in the group chat started profusely swearing and getting pissed off at us, i thought it was just because we wasted his data until i saw ""MY ANDROID PHONE EXPLODED"". It was at that point that i got concerened, because this kid had 2 phones, a brand new iphone, and a spare android phone, both of them had google hangouts installed, he started swearing at me, and i thought he was pranking (he does alot of pranks like this) so i say, ""can i see proof that your phone exploded?"", a few seconds later i see a picture of his 300$ oppo phone, on a concrete slab, on fire, screen completely burnt up.

This  happened yesterday and its still hard to believe. A few weeks ago I  started working at a  local food market, I live in NY and in my city  this place is very popular and a great place to work. I was being  trained and doing quite well, I was even personally complimented by my  manager twice for doing a good job at such a early stage.

Here's  where the F$%# up happens, last Friday I was working a closing shift,  and the whole day my co-worker; lets call her Ally, seems to be having a  rough go. Very quiet, looked depressed and I couldn't help but want to  do something about it. Since working there I showed a lot of initiative  and team work, my other co-workers seemed to really enjoy my presence  there so that's why I thought I would return the favor.

Now  I don't know really know this girl, nor did I have any affinity for  her. All it was, was me thinking I could be a hero for 1 moment and it  totally backfired. She didn't exactly shout NO or tell me to back off,  it was just a quiet shrugg saying "" i dont wanna hug man "" I gently gave  her a half hug and said "" youre awesome, and youre valued here "" she  then replied "" thank you James "" to which I smiled and went back to  work. It was so quick and painless I didnt think anything of it.

4  days go by, and I get called into the office and I am fired  IMMEDIATELY. At first I was shocked, but then they said "" because you  gave an unwanted hug and attention "" then my confusion  was instantly  cured and I looked at them with defeat in my voice "" oh....i know now.. ""

I  could have, and maybe should have put up more of a fight to defend  myself but it seemed futile since being so new there, apparently they  have some really zero tolerance policies there ( family owned business).  Ive decided to just move on and let it go, one reason being I didnt do  anything wrong, and in a lot of ways I dont think this was harassment in  any way. Im only upset because 4 days went by, and the night it  happned; Ally did not seem upset, How did it bother her so much after 4  days to then report me?

I'M SUCH A DUMB FUCK... *Siiiiiigh*
Alright, so about three hours ago which was 3 pm i was gonna go to the gym like i do everyday... The motorcycle is my dad's but i use it too... And it was low on gas ... very, Very, VERY low on gas...  Well tbh it was practically empty. both of us are super lazy to refuel the poor thing  and we only do it when we really need to, and it's a dumb thing to do. Never do this.

Nearest gas station is like a kilometer or two away out of town from where i live... So i start the engine, ride the bike... It's barely moving, like i can hear it's screaming i need gaaaassss... Trrr trrr tttrrrr says the engine, it got me to the square  that leads out of town and to the gas station and then poof it's out of gas completely. I'm struggling in the middle of the crossway when suddenly...

A kid shows up, offering help... He's about 8 or 9 ... Oh believe me most kids here learn driving at this age and stupid me learned when he was 20. Anyway i tell him it's outta gas and he offers to take it to the gas station and asks if I've got any cash... Please don't ask why i even considered doing this, HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW. I'M DUMB AS FUCK, WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING...
 *Siiigh* letting a random kid drive your damn ride to pump gas to it. This is the most ridiculous thing i have ever done in my stupid short life.

He said he ""works"" for the store over there so maybe that's why i decided to not be so reluctant about his offer ... So me the idiot lets the kid drive away alone as i wait for him to come back i start to doubt my choices in life. And i wait. And i wait. And i wait. And wait... Currently it's been half an hour and he's not back. I go to the shop he talked about.

The shop owner said he doesn't work for him but he did know the kid. And he did know his last name and he did know the people who knew where he lived. And then he told me what i did was really stupid and dumb and a very poor life choice. And i Couldn't agree more. I am an idiot. Really. There's no doubt in that. Then as time passes by i decide to tell the bad news to my father and i call him on the phone.

Infuriated. Shouting. And very angry and disappointed in his son. He rushes to where i am to settle things. He's very bad at doing that as he resorts to violence instead of keeping his cool. As time passes by and me and my dad look for the fucking kid. We look. And look. And we look. There's no sign of him anywhere. We checked gas station they said they've seen him but he's not here anymore...

Now I'm worried, angry, and impatient. And I'm late for the gym and I've already burned more than enough calories while looking for this fucking brat. It's been 45 minutes. He's not back yet. My father goes to the kids parents house. I stay at the square. Still waiting. Somehow... i saw a little ray of hope a light at the end of the corridor... (Ok i suck at making it sound dramatic) 

After One fucking hour i see the brat is back with my bike and this time he has brought a friend with him, Oh Cool. Guess What! He saw fit to joyride with my fucking motorcycle because he thinks he earned it for ""helping"" me. *Siiiiigh* how i wanted to punch him in his fucking face^^ but i restrained myself. Calmed down and resorted to simple taunts... I'm a good person. But an stupid one. I still had to go to the gym so i did... And now I'm home. The end. Happy ending to this dumb day.

[deleted],9hvv4w,"So after a week of cramming and not stepping foot out of my house -- unless absolutely necessary -- I decided I needed to take a break and get some fresh air. I was home alone with my brother and I didn't tell him I was leaving the house so if I went missing my family would have no idea what happened to me. I really like to dress up, but my parents have a pretty strict no dressing-up rule, due to the fact we live near a ghetto, so I try to dress-up as much as I can when they aren't around.

I ended up putting on a burgundy v neck sweater on top of a dress shirt with a tie, polished off with some oxfords.

So now I leave my house all dressed up, without telling anyone, without even a phone, and start walking through a ghetto. What could go wrong?

So I crossed a few blocks and started walking beside the park located there. There's a group of kids hanging around the park entrance and before I'm even close to them, one of them yells ""I've just found the whitest person in (enter neighborhood here)"". Once I walk past them, all of them start to move and follow me. When I started to walk faster, the group responded by matching my pace.

Now, earlier in the day I heard one of my coworkers call her pen her, ""baby"" as Starbucks employees can be overly protective of their pens, because they are constantly getting their pens stolen or lost. She even said to me earlier, ""Make sure you get this back because it's my baby.""

Anyways, I was finishing up making whip creams when I could not find a pen to mark the expiration dates on the containers, but I remembered from earlier that my coworker had a pen, so I went up to her and asked for it. She said yes and gave it to me. 

One I was done with my task, I thought I would make a joke in reference to earlier, about her calling her pen her baby. Here's how that conversation went.

Me: Hey here's your pen baby.

Her: What?

Me: I said here's your pen baby back, remember from earlier how you called your pen a baby?

At this point she became overly uncomfortable and said;

Her: Oh yeah. I thought you were calling ME baby...


I had no idea what she was talking about. It took a few moments to figure out that she thought I had said, ""Here's your pen, Baby""

Ambinevolence,2lgk2j,"I've been dating an amazing girl for a bit over a year now. She's pretty chill and progressive, but she comes from a VERY conservative protestant family. Frankly, it's amazing that she isn't disowned - her parents and siblings obviously love her very much, but every time we go to visit they are not shy about voicing their disapproval of her lifestyle choices. Thankfully they're all cordial and the concerns are voiced civilly so there's no raised voices or hurt feelings, but not being part of the family these lectures are quite uncomfortable for me. ESPECIALLY since I'm not spared from her family's criticism.

As you can imagine we don't visit them much. They were kind enough to extend a dinner invitation on Wednesday evening, and since we hadn't seen them in a month or so we took them up on it. Despite the occasional awkward disapproving interjection (which we're both used to by now) things were going well... that is, until I let slip that she and I were thinking about moving in together. At that point her father gave me the coldest gaze I'd ever seen. And he wouldn't stop fucking GLARING at me. From that point on he had no qualms about interrupting me every time I spoke, quoting bible passages to insult me or contradict every single thing I would say in some fashion. I may not have been on exactly the same page as her father before, but we'd gotten along okay nonetheless... it definitely seemed like he was just being rude, obnoxious, and particularly confrontational. Now I'm an extremely even-tempered guy, but he was bagging on me to the extent that I had to excuse myself four goddamn times during dinner because he was pissing me off and I needed to cool down. There were multiple instances where his daughter and wife would even comment on his mean attitude but he seemed to just totally ignore them. This guy obviously intended to goad me.

After dessert my girlfriend and her mother are washing dishes, leaving me and her father alone at the dining room table. After a brief awkward silence I decided to straight-up ask him why he was so upset with me. He revealed that he was wholeheartedly against the idea of his daughter living with an ""unscrupulous heathen"" (his literal words) as that pretty much guaranteed premarital sex. I'd had enough of his shit by this point and decided a dose of reality would straighten him out, but emotion certainly got the best of me and my delivery was incredibly crass. ""If you think it took more than a few weeks to twist your daughter into all kinds of kinky pretzels you can't even imagine and stuff various objects into every hole in her body then you're just being willfully ignorant."" In my defense, I was being honest... she's ridiculously kinky. I still feel bad for being so disrespectful, though.

I have never been punched out of anger before, so when this 64 year old man lunged across the table and struck me I was caught completely off guard. I'm a regular gym-goer and participated in martial arts in the past, but none of that mattered - the next thing I knew I was on my back with this previously-very-collected elderly fellow on top of me in a blood rage. Still dazed from smacking my head on the ground when my chair tipped over, it was all I could do to try and deflect his onslaught of wild blows. It seemed like a fucking eternity before his wife and daughter pulled him off me. I stood up and could feel the sting of blood dripping into my eye. I could taste it in my mouth. I was still dizzy and disoriented but it was obvious that I'd received some pretty solid blows. While I was slightly embarrassed that someone almost twice my age handed me my ass, I nevertheless felt like I won. Like I got him to snap even though he'd been working on me for hours.

My girlfriend ushered me into the bathroom and began to gingerly tend my wounds. Her mother and father were hollering back and forth incomprehensibly in the dining room downstairs; when I heard them say her name I assured her I was fine on my own and urged her to deal with her folks. More incomprehensible yelling ensued, though my girlfriend's voice now joined the chorus. Around the time I'd managed to staunch the bleeding from my eyebrow she returned with my coat and said simply, ""We're leaving."" She was angrier than I'd ever seen her yet managed to remain collected. Normally when we'd leave her parents' house there were fond farewells... warm handshakes, hugs, wishes for prosperity, and blessings abound. Not this time, though. This time there was only her mother crying alone at the dinner table; we didn't even stop to say good-bye. Her father was nowhere to be found. Nothing but silence while we got into the car and left the driveway. A few miles down the road I noticed tears in my girlfriend's eyes. I wanted to be there for her, to comfort her in some way, but I just didn't know how. ""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, feeling stupid that I couldn't come up with something more suave to break the silence. ""Not right now"" she said, her voice strained against the flood of emotion. I put one of my hands in hers and squeezed ever so slightly, letting her know without words that I was there for her when she was ready. She squeezed back, refusing to break down sobbing even as large, heavy tears rolled down her face. We rode the rest of the way without saying anything.

**TL;DR**: *SO's dad intentionally pushes my buttons HARD. I tell him I thoroughly fucked his daughter. He physically attacks me. Everyone loses.*

Now we can get to the story. 

So this happened last night as I was sitting at home with my Girlfriend of a year. A comercial for Taco Bells new cheesy burrito thing came on. My girlfriend has some serious munchies because she wanted to go get one really badly. Being an amazing boyfriend I surprise her by taking her there later that night. We go and pick up 3 of them and started heading back to my place. Then I get the romantic idea to take her to the local lake to look at the stars while we eat. Everything was going amazing, it was nice and cool outside, the stars were out and bright. Then she asks for some hot sauce to go with her burrito. As I'm grabbing for it I realize that this was the same exact place we met about a year ago at a college party. I give her the packet and then reach for one for me. The next thing I hear is a lound scream and then ""Yes, yes. Oh god yes."" I turn around to see her in tears and smiling at me.  I'm fucking confused as hell at this point. Then she says ""Of course I will marry you!"" 

Ends up I had given her [this]( http://imgur.com/on3S4ch) hot sauce packet. She had never seen one that said this before, so she thought I had gotten them to write it on there for her. It was a very awkward rest of the night....",tifu,TIFU by having Taco Bell with my Girlfriend.
disappointed-guy,4wkj8b,"Did not happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

My wife and I have just had our third wonderful child. Not wanting a fourth, we agree I should get a vasectomy. No big deal: just a little snip and removes all the worries with contraception.

My doctor didn't seem to understand why I wanted it, but I quickly dismissed him, insisting I had thought hard about what I wanted and was not going to change my mind. Same with the consultant. I sign the papers and the operation is booked.

A few weeks later, after I wake up from the operation, everything feels fine but numb. Consultant gives me some strong warnings about being careful with my penis over the next fortnight, but I don't take it too seriously.

After my wife has driven me home, we take off my trousers to take a look at the scrotum scar. The head of my penis is wrapped in a soft bandage. She removes it and screams. I look down. It is covered in blood and we can't find my foreskin. Scrotum seems normal.

After we calm down, wife fetches my papers. Turns out I had booked myself in for a circumcision, not a vasectomy. Not their fault: my wife remembered me getting the words confused a few times over the past weeks as well.

Recovery was unpleasant. For a week, woke up every few hours in the middle of the night, somewhere between screaming and crying because the stitches were being stretched. Could not walk properly. Penis looks like someone else's. Two weeks after the operation, I am only just getting anywhere near back to normal. My boss is not impressed either.

And I need to go back to pay for the vasectomy I wanted in the first place.

dick_thrownaway,4vdw36,"So to start with, here's the obligatory ""this actually happened about 4 weeks ago"". Using a throwaway because some people here know me.

4 weeks ago, it was a friday night, I had just turned 19 and my friends and I were going to go spend the night partying to celebrate. One of my best friends works at the local aquarium and the plan was to meet up with him there after he got off from work.

So we get there around 8 pm after the place has closed and he says we can chill out inside while he finishes a few last things. The aquarium has one of those touch tanks where you can pet stingrays and other cool sea critters so we hung out there while we waited for him.

Now I had been to other aquariums before and seen touch tanks but this one was definitely unique. It was very large and has a ton of different species. Everything from hermit crabs to flounder to even a few small sharks. We started poking everything we could, probably giving half the creatures PTSD but once we saw the small sharks we forgot about everything else. There were two. Each was about 2 feet long. They were swimming around in slow circles like sharks do, like they were hunting for something.

Interestingly, they didn't really react when we touched them. They just kept on swimming as if nothing had happened. So since they weren't reacting that much, we started daring each other to do crazier and crazier things to see if they would react. This is where things went wrong. I should probably add that we had pregamed a little so we weren't completely sober.

It started with one of my friends tangling his hand in front of the shark, first for just a instant and then for longer and longer. Then my other friend upped the anti by sticking his tongue in the water. This guy is probably the craziest guy I know. About 5 years ago we used to be really close but we have since drifted apart. But for old times sake, I had called him up the day before and asked him if he wanted to hang out.

So what was so crazy about sticking his tongue in the water? Well he had just gotten it pierced that afternoon and it was still a little bloody.

Now, I know you probably now think you know where this is going, but I promise, you don't.

So he sticks his bloody tongue in the water and the sharks IMMEDIATELY stop their slow circles and start heading his direction. We all start yelling at him to get his tongue out, but he's just laughing maniacally like the joker and tonguing the water like its a girl. He waits till the last instant, till the sharks are about a foot away and then he stands back up. He then looks at me and said something like ""your turn!""

Well I had just been called out. Any other time, I would have laughed at the ridiculous of the situation and gone to see what was keeping my friend but like I said, we had been pregaming and I was not thinking straight.

So I did the only thing I could think of to top that. I waited till the sharks had swam a little ways off, unzipped my pants and dropped my dick in the water. Your birthday, in front of your friends, is not the time to start acting like a pussy right?
So I kind of twirl it around in the water, waiting for the sharks to circle back around and get close. My friend has waited till they were a foot away, so I felt I needed to wait till they were maybe 8 inches away.

My dick is kind of stirring of the bloody water and the sharks sense this and start heading back. They get closer and closer. Suddenly, when they're about 15 inches away, my other friend who were waiting on walks back in. In that instant, I looked up and the sharks lunged for my dick. One shark actually ended up biting into the first one, but the first one got almost its whole mouth around my dick.

I won't go into the gory details except to say that I had always heard on TV that shark's teeth are curved backwards to make it impossible for prey to escape and the TV was not lying.

At the hospital, my foreskin was so shredded that they ended up just cutting it all off.

Four weeks later, [this is what my dick looks like](http://imgur.com/a/nbESD)(3 pictures)

MomChomsky,84r7p7,"Soo.. yeahhh.. this happend very very very recently.. kind of still freaking out/ waiting.. but umm.. so I was in a shared cab service, on my way to explore/ chill and get fucked up in the city over the weekend. While in the "" cab "" we pick up another passenger who happens to be this absolutely hard 7 of a cutie patootie with a booty. I almost immediately felt the tension of mutual attraction as soon as she got into the "" cab "". There was this feeling that we both had quite possibly may be having a full day of adventure, as I was visiting the city. After a nice 7 minutes or so of "" cab ride "" awkwardness, turns out she too, is visiting and was on her way to do some unofficial  pseudo touristy stuff. I told her that, if she's free later, and done with her itinerary, that she should give me a buzz and possibly go for a walk and catch some drinks. So I give her my number, and she is absolutely down and thinks it sounds like a great idea.. fuck.. yeah..🤘

So that's a very great start of my day, feeling good. Got some potential panty pie on deck, its the weekend, I'm almost broke, but my spirits not broken. Beautiful sunny day. I'm struttin around because damn it I'm feeling good. Now there was a  slight guilt looming because I had some responsibilities that I was sort of putting off, but I was goin/ planning to deal with it later. I just needed some of my day and weekend to be about relaxing and feeling alive and free. So I guess I didn't reallllly have the whole day free..but if I fucked off I kind of did? Ignorance is bliss I guess.
I forgot to mention this but, at this point the ""cab"" ride has been over.. it's actually been like 23 minutes of it being over.. and at this point I'm buying beer and shooting the shit with the store clerk, whose going on about a 700$ bottle of bourbon I give absolutely negative 3 fucks about. In that moment of giving negative 3 fucks, I get a text alert. I wait until my transaction is finished before check my phone. Walk out the store, bum a cigarette from some fellow smoker strangers, light it up, dig in my pocket, grab my phone.. and low and behold.. the alert is a text from ol random "" cab "" cutie chick. 
Her message reads something like, "" hey, this is blah blah blah, from just earlier in the car. Turns out, this place I had in mind no longer exist and I'm free and wanna take you up on your offer to chill ! Are you still in the area ""

.. Oh how good was it to still be in the area. I dropped my location pin and told her to bring some food. 

She delivered.. came through, we are talking and having a blast and it was just soo fucking obvious that we wanted to fuck each other.. like .. had I just put all my social etiquette to the side and was just, you know at some point in mid conversation like, "" hey.. all this drinking and talking is cool. But are you just tryna sex?"" She would of dropped her social etiquette persona an been like, "" you top or bottom? ""

So after a really chill long day in the park, drinking and getting to know each other.. I realized.. damn it's getting late, and I totally have that stupid annoying thing I have to do before days done.. but this date is going so fucking well.. and even though I have the strongest inclination that this will go all the way, there's the great chance of this all being apart of the big illusion and assumption that this person is actually "" like that "". So I just break the ice like, "" hey, I'm having a blast and I'm totally down to chill. But I kind of have to do this thing I've been putting off, but I'm conflicted because this is so fun. I was thinking we can go to my place, grab dinner and maybe &lt;insert offer to sex but isn't really a direct request for sex.. some stereotypical activity that leads to it &gt; ""

She obliges and we tipsy not quite drunkenly stumble away. We pick up another cab, ending back up like we all started, except this time, we are intimate and are extremely expressive sexually.. shits getting heavy.. it's almost like I'm actually still in the first cab.. day dreaming and fantasizing about this actual moment. It's unreal, I'm excited and I'm really greatful. Trying my hardest to not let the boldness that the alcohol creates, ruin this absolute MVP level of a chivalrous performance I've been putting on.

BOOM! Get to my room, and the mood is so chill. Shoes come off, grand tour, and just setting the mi casa tu casa mood. I put on something to watch on the laptop and we order Thai, we get into more heavy convo AND bonding. Food arrives, we laugh, we eat.. best. Fucking. Unofficial pop up date ever! 

I lean in and kiss her, and it just escalates from their, shirts come off, pants come off, socks, jewelry. She's on top of me and she has the cutest body. Fit and tight and honestly, I never get lucky with this kind of stature. I'm just in full appreciation mode, and I'm just lovin rubbin and huggin this absolute gem of a human being. I lay her on her back, and am being silly as I over exaggerate my romanticizing by kissing down her legs.. and holy shit.. just my luck! She has the hottest toes ever..sorry, I'm a foot guy, and a good toe is very hard to come across. I start making my way back up the leg,  and through the inner thigh, obviously goin for my lint licker attack. She then suddenly closes her legs, pops up and says, "" I gotta go to the bathroom"". No big deal, it's happened to me. There's nothing more annoying than pissy boner. I see nothing alarming of this, I show her to the bathroom, run back to my room, kick off my underwear and dive under the covers. She gets back to my room, climbs into my bed and we just start making out. HEAVY! I say fuck it, and I just went for it. Grabbed a condom, slipped it on, then slipped it in.. i immediately lose my boner. I think it's because I had been hooking up with another girl previously, and we didn't use condoms, so when I put it on, my dick reacted like it was dipped in cold water. 

I avoid shame by presuming to go down on her, while simultaneously trying to get my penis to work like a broken tv. As I'm goin down, I feel something in my mouth.. not moving or anything.. just unusual but not quite foreign..she's laying on her back, eyes to the ceiling and in complete ecstasy. Slyly but quickly, put my fingers in my mouth to pick what ever that weird thing in my mouth was. I look at my fingers to quickly examine what it was.. and it's a.. like beedie, clearish small, rice grain looking thing.. I try to quickly play in my head if I've seen this ever before from a woman's vagina, and to just ignore it..but I can't. I'm too much of a hypochondriac, and my curiosity/concern gets the best of me. So I myself, take a bathroom break, but really I just wanted to inspect myself, and recollect.. because it's all starting to dawn on me, that this is a complete stranger, and this is all happening really fast. I get to the bathroom and turn on the light, and inspect my pubes.. I haven't shaved in a while, so they've gotten pretty long.. but I notice another beedie thing, in my pubes. I pick it out and I inspect close in the light and my fucking heart stops and I have a nightmare of all flashbacks.. I say to myself, "" is.. is this a fucking crab egg ?!?!"" I put the beedie thing on a napkin and just start inspecting myself.. and theres beedie things in my beard!! I'm freaking the fuck out ripping at my beard and pubes and then all the sudden I just start throwing up in the sink.. like not liquidy throw up either, the chunky solid stuff.. O m f g.. theirs crabby beedie things in my throw up..AND THEIR SWIMMING AROUND !! It's crabs!! Its fucking crabs!! I immediately grab my electric razor jump in the bath tub and start going Edward scissor hands on my face and pubes and even my asshole, legs I even almost cut my hair. I'm showering, freaking out falling and slipping around. I don't even grab a towel when I jump out of the shower and bolt to my room. I burst through my room, to address her.. and ..she's fucking gone...poof..gone. I freak out even more, running around my apartment complex naked at 4 in the morning looking for this crabby bitch. I start calling and texting.. no response. I grab my pillows, bed cover, Sheet, the clothes I was wearing and just throw them the fuck out. Luckily I had a tube of permethrin from a few years ago when I got scabbies at a hostile in Denmark. I wasn't sure if this would work the same.. I sat on a crate naked in my room for 3 days, just tweaking and being absolutely fucking tripped out by what the fuck had just occurred. I think my quick reactions nipped everything in the bud so nothing spread. But am still waiting. Scared to be home now in my bed 

Tldr: met a really cool random girl in a cab. Ended up having a great time.went back to my place and she accidentally/wrecklessly? Infested me and my apartment with lice. And also  ate crabs from the human shore

NSA_Chatbot,3xx6he,"This wasn't today.  At the urging of several Redditorsover several months, I present one of my greatest fuckups.  

tl;dr: The government of India shot a tiger because I made a typo. 

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I was hired to get the code for a company under control.  They made GPS tracking collars for animals.  Everything had grown organically, and so as an engineer they figure that I could get an organized codebase installed.  I'd been programming since I was eight years old, and with fresh training they figured I would be ideal for getting organized, clean code.  

I didn't know how to program in C, but I learned.  I got a book and read up on the ideas and constraints.  I learned about registers and bit-wise manipulation and all the rest.  Eventually I even got to the point where I was able to work out a bug between the chip manufacturer and the chip burner manufacturer to get the registers moved.  That solved a global bug, so if you ever used a 10F20X with a Quickwriter and it worked, you're welcome.

I also made the code modular, so when parts changes I could just use a different #include and it would work just fine.  This was instrumental when the Memory War ended.  You may not know this, but before Flash there were other architectures.  We used SEEPROM, and we ordered literally the last 300 SEEPROM chips in the world to tide us over.  They didn't have dies in them, so they were just dummies.  ""Hey, NSA, can you fix this?""  I could.  We found a pin-compatible Flash replacement, and I had already started on the skeleton, so three days later we had Flash compatibility and we were good to go forever.   

I also didn't know how to deploy a repository, so I read up on CVSNT and Tortoise, and put those into place and made sure it all got backed up regularly.  CVS and WinMerge saved my butt so many times I feel like I owe the writers each a nice bottle of Scotch.  

Anyway, one of the constraints with embedded code is your footprint.  On a desktop, who gives a shit how much code you write?  Are you at a gig?  Forty gigs?  Fuck it, it compiles, ship it.  Not so in embedded; one of the chips I used had 24 bytes of RAM and 512 bytes of Flash, no registers.  (No, I didn't forget a prefix.  BYTES.)  I figured out a tip for using pointers to shrink the code footprint down from 99% to 92%, meaning we could add more features.  (If I overused it, the footprint went up again, so it required some trial and error.)  Time of day, satellite sight checks, seasonal changes, all kinds of stuff.


When I re-wrote the GPS parsing library to use pointers, I missed (MISSED) a pipe.  Fuck.  It was supposed to look something like this: 


    GPS.longitude = RS232_longitude_degrees_tens;

    GPS.longitude &gt;&gt; 4;

    GPS.longitude |= RS232_longitude_degrees_ones;

But I fucked up the pipe, so it was 

    GPS.longitude = RS232_longitude_degrees_ones;

So the tenths digit of longitude was always 0, meaning that there was a 400-mile wide swath it could have been at.  It got through so many tests and even to a test customer who GOD DAMN HIM happened to live where that data was actually valid.  The screenshot even made it into the *fucking manual* where it could mock me.  It wasn't until I re-wrote the VB parsing program to deal with leading zeroes that we noticed the problem in all its motherfucking majesty.  

I found out what was going on when I got a call from a coyote researcher in Rhode Island.  She asked why the coyotes were always on the highway.  Well, that's because it likely has a clean line of sight to the sky -- I shit you not, there's a highway right on the 0s in Rhode Island.  Okay, she asks, then why are the also in the middle of the ocean?

I answered, “coyotes don't rent speedboats, do they?”  

For the record, they do not. 

When I saw the bug, I knew exactly what I'd fucked up.  I said something to the customer when I saw it.  “I have to go.  I see what I did wrong.”  It wasn't a maybe thing, it was immediately obvious.  Maybe if I'd paid more attention.  Maybe if my now-ex-wife's pregnancy wasn't complicated and we'd been wondering if a late-term abortion was required to save her life.  (the kid in question is now 9, and the ex is quite happy with her new partner.)  Maybe if I'd had more experience.  

But no, none of those maybes were true, and I'd fucked it up, all by myself.  We'd sent a hundred collars to the government of India to eventually get every tiger in the world fitted with a collar.  Their goal was to find every poacher and murder them; they deserved it, frankly.  But no, I fucked it up.  The government of China wanted collars for Hanguls (deer) to see if they'd work for pandas too.  But no, I fucked it up.  

The company went out of the animal tracking side, because there was more money to be made in tracking people.  Less customization as well, since the manufacturers (Microchip) would program an incremental ID number into the chip for $0.37 a chip when you bought a reel. That was a lot less than I was being paid, so they “went in a new direction”. One without me.  The CEO brought in an independent auditor so see if I was sabotaging the code on purpose, and instead I got a reference and a quote saying my code is “better than most”.  I'm proud of that human tracking code, it was solid and the way I wrote it cut down on the codebase from 10k+ versions down to 2, 1 of which was deprecated.  

Eventually the tech was sold to lo-jack.  I ran into a person wearing a wrist tracker at a party and it was still running after ten years, only requiring battery changes.  That code is the brains behind the Project Lifesaver transmitters, and that project has saved thousands of lives.  (The real thanks for that belong to the people who go out looking for the people who go wandering.) 

I found out years later that most of the collars that got sent out worked awesome.  Crocodiles, wolverines, dolphins, whales, even some torpedoes.  It was a bad batch of about 50 that had the shitty code.  It was patchable, but only with power tools and physical contact.  (Those with bad data could not be fixed after the fact, but was useful anyway.)

So in order to fix the collars, the CEO of the company went to India to meet with the government officials to reprogram the firmware in tranquilized tigers.  From what I understand, the tigers did survive and the data was eventually used to track some poachers who ... let's be diplomatic and say they fared worse than the tigers.

All right, I'm going to karaoke.  Good night.   ",tifu,TIFU by making the government of India shoot some tigers.
TuxedoGing,1kahst,"Guys, I've never really fucked up this badly, and I really don't know what to do.

The other day I was chilling with my girlfriend, we were in another city for her cousin's wedding so we had our own hotel room to ourselves. Everything was going great, we were having a great weekend, and I thought it was really the time of our lives.

Of course, like any close young early 20s couple, having our own hotel room meant quite a bit of sexy times. It was great. We both discovered each other's bodies in ways we hadn't before. It was pretty much perfect...

Until I fucked things up royally.

After cuddling up in bed after quite a bit of foreplay, she asked me what my #1 fantasy was, and she would do it for me, as long as I followed along with hers. I always thought mine was a little awkward, but hey, we were together for quite a while now, nothing could really go wrong, right?

So, I explained everything out to her. My #1 Fantasy is me coming home after a long, stressful day of work, completely tired out, and needing to relieve a whole load of stress and frustration from the day. So, to accomplish that, I lay back on the bed, and start to masturbate, letting everything all out. However, it's taking especially long to climax, and my wrist begins to get sore, and I start to get really frustrated. However, when all seems to be lost, I feel a hand on my wrist, and I look up to see her, pretending to be Casey Janssen, my favorite baseball player.

(Now if you don't know who Casey Janssen is, he's the closing pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays, and one of the best CP's in the league. For those unfamiliar with baseball, the closer's role is to come in at the end of a close game and finish it off without letting the other team take the lead.)

""C-Casey..?"" I ask.

""Don't worry"" she says. ""It's me, Casey Janssen. I'm here to help you close this out."" She then, masquerading as Janssen, begins to jack me off, letting me finish and giving me the best climax possible.

However, when I told this to her, she just looked like she got really weirded out about me wanting her to pretend to be him, and we didn't really do much more sexually, and she didn't really talk to me much since for the rest of the weekend. Now we're both back in our own respective homes, and she hasn't talked to me since. :(

Did I fuck up, guys? She's not responding to my calls. I really hope she'll come around but I think I ruined the best relationship I ever had.

summary : I asked my girlfriend to pose as my favorite baseball player to help me get off, now she's not talking to me

Reddit_Executive,2ere15,"As with most stories on here, this is from my teen years. Long story, but that's what you're here for, right?

*Some preface to get you up to speed.*

I was 18, just graduated from high school. I had a fairly nice ""office job"" for the summer. My friend's dad got me and my friend a job in the mail room there. Nothing too demanding, just sort out the mail and cart it around, handing it out to the appropriate people. Collect mail and send it out. Easy job, good pay to fund my summer nights. 

I had gotten rather buddy-buddy with the CEO and owner of the whole gig. He was a fairly nice guy. Your typical CEO family man, with a picture of him, his wife, and chubby little daughter on his desk. Very ornate wood desk, about like an executive's desk. I was always polite, lot of ""sir"" being used by me. He offered to take me in once I was done with college if I couldn't find work. I was rather ecstatic about that. 

*This is where the story begins.*

It was labor day, and I was in our downtown area getting some coffee from Starbucks. My friends had all gone to some vacation destination with their families. My family couldn't quite afford anything at the moment. No big deal, I figured I'd just bum around town, maybe see a movie. That's when I saw her.

Cute blonde girl I had never seen before. She was slim, around 5'5"", tanned skin, green eyes, nice boobs. Not hot, but very cute. She was just sitting by herself at a table looking lonely and bored. I decided why not, and went over to say hello. 

Let's get something straight, I'm not very good looking. Think Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) in 2006. Not bad, but not great. So, imagine my surprise when she lights up and looks delighted to talk to me. We hit it off and start talking a lot. We spend the day together talking and stuff. Then things get sexual around dinner. She says how mad she is at her parents for having work errands to run while she's home. And she tells me she wants to do some fantasy she's always had. 

Her father apparently LOVES his garage. It's his little man cave with a car working area, wood working area, and a big leather couch with a big tv. And of course, she want to bang all over it. Being 18 and a man, I couldn't turn it down. She said that her parents would be out all night and we'd have the place to ourselves for about 3 more hours. I scarfed down my dinner, we got some condoms, and it was off to her place.

She started by giving me some amazing head in her dad's recliner. She said she wanted the easy one out so we could have more fun later. Little break. We did it on her dad's rolly thing that you use to go under cars. Another break (I'm not a pornstar after all). She tells me she wants to finish this with me bending her over her dad's wood working bench and fucking her from behind. Naturally, I obliged her request. As we're going at it she turns and says she wants to try anal. At this point, I'm thanking God for this horny little angel sent to me this Labor Day. We work it in, and start off slow. Eventually she wants it harder, so I go harder; and the bench is banging loudly against the wall, she's moaning, and I'm feeling like some amazing god of butt fucking. 

Here's the thing, the banging and moaning overpowered the sound of the garage door opening. I'm about to cum when I see headlights making our shadow on the wall. And I'm cumming in this girl's butt as I hear ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TWO FUCKING DOING!"" I pull out, well fall out is more right because there was no staying hard after hearing an angry dad yell. 

I turn around and there's my boss. I'm standing naked in front of my boss with jizz and daughter-ass dripping off my dick. This is where I'd like to say that said something epic, slapped his daughter on the ass, and strolled outta there. But really, I just panicked and stumbled for my pants on his chair, pulled them on and ran outta there. No shoes or shirt.  

Needless to say, I was fired the next day for some trumped-up reason. I never heard from her again.

So me and my girlfriend are in my room, and we start fooling around, getting kinda horny. She puts her hand in my boxers, so I return the favour. Things escalate and she says she wants to suck my dick (NB: First time oral). I of course love the idea and let her do it. It feels amazing, and I start to get close to cumming...

Knock knock. 

Mum is at the door. Fuck. The doorknob is turning. Shit. In she comes! 

Luckily, I'm wearing a really baggy hoodie, so covered up my junk quick enough to hide my dignity. It's a nice soft hoodie, and I learned it feels nice on your shaft. 

Nice enough to finish the job. Now I'm fucking cumming and mum is in the room asking about dinner. 

As I said earlier, this was my first time getting sucked off, so as you guys can imagine I was exploding at this stage. Mum didn't notice though, and I thought I was safe. 

However...

The force of the ejaculation and the overwhelming feeling of relief meant my hand, holding the bottom of the hoodie, slipped off, and before I could do anything, my mother witnessed my penis spurting man juice all over the place. Including directly into my eye. 

Tldr: Had dick sucked, mum walked in while I came, I dropped the hoodie covering my dick and came on my own face.

Shamed-I-Am-Dumb,2dzpca,"As a confidence technique on job interviews I find out who will be interviewing me, I find a picture of them online, I print it, and I masturbate onto the picture. I know it sounds silly but it gives me a psychological boost of sorts. During the interview I keep thinking of what I did to their image, and it is kind of hard to be intimidated by somebody if you came all over them a few minutes ago.

Well I really screwed up recently. I was in the office bathroom a few minutes prior to my interview, doing my technique, and I somehow don't hear the bathroom door open. So somebody is in there, and they surely hear me masturbating. I walk out and I am horrified to see a person at the sink turn around and stare at me. Then I saw him look horrified. He was looking at what was in my hands. It was a picture of him, covered in semen. He was the guy who was going to interview me.

Ok well to star off I have never been to a festival before, and since a friend bought a ticket for me I was keen to go. A few other friends managed to come along as well and I was pretty excited going in, and of course brought an arsenal of drugs.

So first night, we get in, set up the tent, immediately start drinking and taking drugs. We go out to dance at the main stage and all is going well, were all having an amazing time.

I find this girl dancing and start talking to her. It was fun and she said she wanted to go back to my tent, cool lets do it.

We get to my tent and she starts giving me the best head that I had experienced in my entire life. She's really going at it and then I feel that something isn't right, something wasn't right at all. I hadn't came and I was feeling liquid come out of my cock.

It was blood, she ripped the shit out of my frenulum. I yell out ""you broke my cock!"" and I hear my friend laugh outside the tent (he was sleeping in a hammock next to us). She then gives me a crazy look and starts going at it again, stops, looks at me again with blood all over her face and tells me ""I'm a vampire now""

ShamefulPubicHairBag,30xppt,"I can no longer put into words what compelled me to start collecting pubic hair from my roommate. I can not articulate a particular motivation. Compulsion is the term that best fits. It is a genuine compulsion. 

About 2 years ago is when it began. I was in the shower. Music was playing, because we have one of those speakers that goes on a shower wall. As ""Echoes"" by Pink Floyd started I noticed a few strands of pubic hair on the shower floor. Not my pubic hair, but the pubic hair of my roommate. For some reason I was completely captivated. I just stared at it. Before I knew it, ""Echoes"" was over and the shower water had cooled, but I was still staring at his pubic hair. Without thinking much about it, I finally picked the strands up. 

I put them into a ziplock bag. That's how it began.

Now, every time I see pubic hair of my roommate, I pick it up and add it to the bag. Over the months it has started to become pretty full. It's a very good collection. 

I know it brings my mental condition into question, but I say with all honesty that bag is my most prized possession. When I go to sleep, I put it under the pillow next to me. Every morning I kiss the outside of the bag, just briefly and very tenderly. Putting a new strand into the bag is sort of like a little ritual of mine, it's very comforting. I find that when I become stressed when I am without the bags presence. 

Well I made a horrible error today. Usually when I leave my room, I put the bag under my blanket. I don't know what I was thinking, but today I just left it in top of my pillow and I left my door open. 

My bad errors coincided with additional bad luck, as when I was in the kitchen my roommate decided to go into my room to borrow my charger, as he foolishly left his at his office. When I returned to my room, I was horrified to see my roommate standing by my bed looking at my bag. I have never in my life experienced such a sensation of overwhelming dread and terror. 

I could see by the look on his face that he knew it was his own pubic hair. He did not say any words, he just stared at me. The expression on his face will haunt my mind forever. Forever. 

I tried to explain. I can't even recall everything I said. But I can tell you it was incoherent, rambling, stammering...

I know I admitted I'd been doing it for years. I know that. 

I remember him asking me, the disgust and confusion in his voice, ""Why?"" 

I could not answer. I started to leave, turned around and practically begged him, tears in my eyes, to just leave the bag alone. Then I left the apartment. 

I write this from Starbucks. I am in a state of horrible shame and panic. If he tells other people about this I do not know how I will ever be able to recover my reputation. I do not even know how I will continue to live with him. 

I have forced myself to accept that I will no longer be able to collect his hair to add to the bag. But I have to hope that he hasn't thrown it out. That's my fear right now, the safety of the bag. If the bag is safe I can keep it. I'll always keep it. I swear to you I will keep it forever. If I die when I'm 100 you can bet your ass that bag will be on the pillow next to me. 

But I am so humiliated. How can I ever face my roommate? It's just too horrible. Too awkward. I feel I am drowning in anxiety. 

I believe that I will write an apology to my roommate. I will leave it on his door. And I will move out, when he is at work. In an envelope I will leave the rent for 2 months. 

I will move out. I have to move out. But if he tells our friends, I think I will move to an entirely new state. Start fresh. 

Why couldn't I have just hidden the bag?

TIFU_mods,4cph67,"Dear /r/tifu subscribers,

It has now been just a little over 4 years since the creation of our subreddit. Throughout those 4 years /r/tifu has rapidly grown in size from a few-thousand subscribers to have over 5 million, has become a default and has undoubtedly offered a wide variety of memorable stories about human error. However, as time has shown again and again, all good things must once come to an end.

For a few months now, the moderation team has been discussing the future of the subreddit. As moderation had grown increasingly more difficult and time-demanding due to the heavy influx of users and the large number of posts, we were finding it difficult to maintain the quality of the sub. As a result, we took steps such as creating the common fuck-up list and bringing new moderators on board.

With time, it became apparent that the steps we were taking weren't bringing in much of a difference. Along with that, we found that the moderation team itself didn't have the energy to deal with the wide number of posts involving repetitive fuck-ups, bodily fluids and sexy sex. After lengthy discussion, we decided that /r/tifu had run its course in the current format and a change of direction was necessary.

One of the factors that we took into consideration in our decision was the long-term prospect of text-based storytelling communities. By today's standings, they are a declining trend not just on reddit, but throughout the internet. While our change of direction was mainly motivated by different factors, we believe that adapting to the trends gaining popularity on reddit today early will also help us ensure the longevity of our subreddit.

As of today, /r/tifu will focus on sharing gifs and videos of animals fucking up. Our goal with this is to create a more positive and relaxed atmosphere inside our community and as paradoxical as it may sound, return to our roots of providing entertaining content to the internet in the process.

We'd like to thank all of our subscribers that have made the last 4 years what they have been and with the other side of the same statement, we'd like to invite each and every single one of you to take part and enjoy the next 4, in a new and improved /r/tifu. Please take the time to read the sidebar to familiarize yourself with our new rules and guidelines. Happy posting!

classic4life,66nhnr,"Alright, so this actually did happen today.. 

Today, I woke up in my normal routine, shower shave etc.  Then I come out to see what my wife's got going for breakfast,  and see a pinkish red smoothy of some kind. 

Naturally I make an off hand joke about it being an afterbirth.  I follow this gem with a song about the noises a baby would make in a blender to the tune of ""Old McDonald's Farm"" (similar awful songs are normal for what my wife affectionately refers to as ""Breakfast Tourettes"")  naturally my wonderful wife humours me and laughs along.. But there's a hint of incredulity, as if she can't quite believe what she's listening to. Naturally I think nothing of it.  

That's when she interrupts me to point out the date. I don't clue in right away, but ever so slowly, it dawns on me what I'd done, the sheer magnitude of my fuck up.. 
As I realize that today is the anniversary of the car accident where I flailed my pregnant wife into a semi, and killed our unborn baby.

cattlerus,2ogx4b,"I have a cattle farm with about 65 head in Oklahoma. The farm is 163 acres and I have barbed wire fences to contain the cattle. I had been having trouble with fence repairs for a while and last month a had 11 head stolen. At $1000 per head that's a substantial loss for a small operation. So to keep rustlers out and to keep from having to run several more strands of barbwire, I decided to electrify the newest strand that I recently had run. I went down to Tractor Supply and got a Gallagher M2800 Fence Energizer. This would be good for 50 miles of line. I figured I'd needed to go with the bigger unit since barbed wire is a lower gauge than the thin wire that electric fences normally have. Since I had only about 5 miles of fence I wanted to be electric, I figured that to be about the right size. 

I put in grounding spikes about ever 100 yards, checked for any breaks in the wire and got the unit hooked up. I was pretty pleased with myself that I got everything done and good to go. 

A couple of days later I was out mowing a section of the fence line when I came across a tree that had fallen down on my fence and the wire was in my way. I had turned the fence off before I started mowing so I figured I would ride up to the wire and just toss it aside so I could just keep on mowing without stopping to get off my tractor. 

It turned out that I didn't turn the power off after all. 

I'm sitting on the tractor with the live wire in my left hand and my right hand grabbing the steering wheel. The first thing I felt was the intense throbbing of my testicles trying to bust out of my jeans like that monster in the Alien movie busting out of that guys chest.  

I could actually feel the ignition firing in my brain every time that engine turned over. Every nerve in my entire body was lit up like a fast strobe on a Christmas tree. I was one with that engine and there was nothing I could do about it. It had total control over me, my thoughts and all my bodily functions. 

I would have never imagined that a human could vomit, pee and shit simultaneously. My bowels were throbbing wildly at the same rate as my pecker and guts and they all evacuated like BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG... I crapped my pants like a hundred times real close together. 

After about 10 minutes or maybe 8 seconds of holding on to the wire I still can't let go. All the other electric fences I had ever been around were probably only 9 volts and merely gave a little sting to make you aware that it was there. But I wanted to give those assholes a real jolt if they ever tried to steal any of my cattle again and this thing was hitting me like a 15 lb sledge hammer in my chest and was starting to hurt like hell. I figured that this was pretty much it for me so I kinda gave up on somebody rescuing me and decided that I probably deserved this for being an asshole for wanting to shock people for stealing my cattle. I just couldn't let go. 
I just begged for God to kill me quick so I wouldn't have suffer this hellacious situation anymore or till the tractor ran out of gas.  

I really don't know how I I let go of that wire. I just woke up looking straight up at the blue sky, the tractor was off and the live wire was laying about a foot away. I guess I blacked out and fell off the tractor landing on the ground and the mower killed itself off when I left the seat. I must had had a thousand seizures and thrown the wire off from the wild convulsions I was having. 

I was sunburned, my whole body hurt and ached like I had the flu so I just laid there for a while til I could gather some strength and straighten out my thoughts so I could get back to the house. I got myself up and looked at the tractor. Hell no I wasn't going to get back on that goddamn thing! so I walked back to the house and laid down and slept for 12 hours. 

Upon waking up, I instantly noticed several things. Everything looked at least 50 times brighter and more vivid than it was before, my nuts are twice the size that I last remembered them, my left eye will not open all the way and my right eye will not close all the way, my fingernails feel like they are over a foot long even though they are the same length as they were and every time I think of mowing the grass my left arm twitches suddenly. 

The good news is that that day changed my life forever. I have a new outlook and respect for things, I like people better and I notice the little things that happen all around me and I appreciate them more. 

The electric fence is shut off permanently.

moistermind,5mvrau,Me and my friends were at my house and we read the TIFU about the guy who glued his ass cheeks together and it disgusted everyone but me. I was actually intrigued to see what it was like to have two separate mounds of flesh glued into one being the retard I am today. After they left I started researching if anyone else had done it before and some tried but stopped because it didn't work. I had the mindset that I might as well try and it probably wouldn't work anyway and for me that was enough. So I got to the washroom you know cleaned my pipes and then got to work. At first I was hesitant because as I got out the glue I started to worry about if this would be long term but I realized that it would dry and I could painfully yet still pull it off. So I put glue all over my right testicle and then over my left and I basically out them together. At first the sticky connection felt week so what I did was I rubbed some over my pubes and then put the balls together and rubbed them back and forth until they were practically tied together. I sat there on the toilet already trying to find ways to deglue my nuts until it dried. Once I got up I realized that my balls shrunk in size. Like they got smaller to accommodate the pressure of having to be stuck together. When I got up it felt like having one testicle instead of two and wearing any pants hurts like fucking he'll and underwear is a long shot. I can't take a piss properly cause my testicles add weight and it hurts to adjust my dick. Whenever I get an erection it feels exactly the same as trying to rip gum out of your hair. I basically have one huge testicle now and my pubic hair just fucking flattened and glued across it. My dick fucking hurts and it feels like I'm being kicked in the balls every 5 minutes. I can't even sit down properly unless I lie on my back. I've told my friends about it and they told me that I should see a doctor and I'm planning to soon but for now I might as well make a TIFU post about it. ,tifu,TIFU By gluing my testicles together...

Typical night out, I went by myself and met a whole bunch of old friends. We had a great time and were dancing to sweet rock music. Out of the blue my friends and I (all three girls) were pushed into the DJ Booth in front of us. 

I turn around and see this sleezy asshole with a gold tooth jumping up and down and being overall way too excited for it to be a coincidence or accident of some sort. People around us were already screaming at him and I saw that one of my friends was hurt in the chest cause she bumped right into the corner of the booth.

He just laughed and was like 'what, we're all having fun here'. I disagree and things get heated. We push each other around for a while until he pushed a little too hard. I'm 5.1. And a girl. You don't go pushing tiny ladies in a club. Especially not when you look like a tool with that gold tooth. So I punched him in the face, trying to knock that stupid grin off his face. Worked like a charm. Security saw everything, agreed with me and escorted the Slimeball out of the club.

trophytacos,2bh7l7,"I grew up in California and my family moved to the east coast the summer right before I entered college (which is also in the east coast). I met my girlfriend freshman year in the dorms. She was the only one from California and she had even just moved to my hometown (from within California) right before college so we really bonded over being the only two Californians in the hall. We have been dating for three and half years now and a lot of times during short holidays, she would come stay with me and my family instead of flying back to California.

We graduated this year and since neither of us secured a job, she moved back with her parents and we've kept a long distance relationship. I've been applying to jobs in her area (my hometown) and the area I'm living at (where my parents moved to) and about a week ago, I got a call back from a company in California to come in for an interview. I was pretty happy for this opportunity because that meant I could go see my girlfriend and so I flew to California and my girlfriend picked me up at the airport.

But when I went inside began exploring, I started getting dejavu until I asked my girlfriend ""What street do you live on?"" She replied with my old street name and I don't know why I did not say anything to her about it but I continued to keep it to myself. Her room was the smallest in the house in which use to be a guest room when I lived there (I'm guessing it's because they moved in as she left for college so she had to take the smallest room when she moved in) and her 15 year old sister had my old room.

This is the part where I fucked up, in the middle of the night I had to take a leak and since the bathroom is not connected to the guest room, I had to walk down the hall way. I stumbled back in my half-asleep state and when I was back in the room, I used my hands to feel my way around the room because I wasn't familiar with the furniture. When I felt where the covers were next to the back of my girlfriend's head, I crawled in and went to sleep spooning her. 

The problem is that it was the wrong room.

I had subconsciously walked back to my old room which is now her 15 year old sister's room. I woke up this morning to her sister screaming in my ears, and her parents rushing into the room. I tried explaining to them and apologized to her sister but my girlfriend it still pissed off at me and her parents kicked me out of the house.

Now I'm staying at a motel and my flight leaves tomorrow. I know if I don't fix this before I go it will be over but I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** - Girlfriend's parents moved into my old house, I stumbled into my old room which is her 15 year old sister's now in the middle of the night and slept with her.


**Update**: Girlfriend called me to come over to talk with her and her family before my flight. Apparently her parents didn't know I grew up there and thought I was lying through my teeth when I told them yesterday. I showed some pictures of me around the neighborhood plus some high school photos as proof. They are less pissed now, her dad even gave me a pat on the back. Her sister has been gossiping with her friends and now thinks it was totally cool she slept in the same bed with a dude. Girlfriend still hurt so I cancelled my flight to spend some time with her, she's suggesting we both stay at the motel tonight instead of sleeping in her house.

**Also...I really don't care if you think this is fake. It's my life and it's real to me. I'm just happy things are turning out fine.**",tifu,TIFU by sleeping with my girlfriend's fifteen year old sister.
samnymr,3l1nzl,"SO i thought this would be a cool prank,

Having seen mythbusters i thought it would be funny to tape everything in my girlfriends room to the ceiling of her room , So basically it looked like walking into an upside down room. 

My friend helped me get everything up onto the ceiling, e.g. desks whilst i stuck everything down, It was a perfect plan, Fast forward an hour, she returns from her first day of Uni, Walks upstairs  whilst me and my friend begin to smirk.

She shouts both our names and we walk upstairs laughing, She states ""do you think this is funny? how am i gonna get this shit down?"" To which she then slammed the door. 

Move on a couple of mins we here a loud bang, then another. Turns out ducttape isn't super sticky on old paint. so now im sat in the ER with her in a bed recovering from being hit on the head with a desktop pc.

starwars2016,3vt1na,"This happened yesterday.  So it was Sunday. I had just finished mowing my yard and cleaning up outside.  I had just jumped out of the shower and had just rolled a nice joint.   I was settled in and very comfortable.  I was watching COPS on tv and was about to light my joint when suddenly I hear the door bell.  I walk to the door an notice two mormons with their white t shirts and black pants.  I am like shit, fuck!   I did not really feel like being an asshole but they were interrupting my smoke time but , I let them in.  So I open the door, they introduce themselves to me , I let them in, they ask me what I was up to. I told them I had just finished working on the yard and was about to relax and watch some tv and have a smoke.  So they sit down and start asking me about my religion, I tell them I believe we are destined to die in this life and that when we die, we die and thats that.  This is where I fucked up.   I kicked back the lazy boy as they are yapping away about something about their religion.  I take the lighter out and spark it up.  I take a deep inhale , and then exhale.    Now they are about 7 feet away from me, I am blowing the smoke casually to the left of me, away from them.  So they are talking and then all of a sudden they look at each other and stand up, they tell me they have to go and that they wish me the best of luck in the future.  I am like ok, see you laters!.  They leave, I close up and lock up and go back to my seat and start watching COPS on tv.  Gotta say thats my favorite show.    So then about 10 minutes later, I hear a loud knock on the door, "" Police! Open up!""  I swear I sit there with the joint in my mouth and thinking like Oh shit! its the fucking cops!   At this point I know they can smell it.  What can I do?  Ive watched plenty of COPS and know that they will knock that door down if I dont open up.  So I put the joint out and put it in a jar, and go to the door.  I open the door and is two officers.  

They ask me if I live here. Im like uhhhh yeah, they ask if any one else is in here with me?  I say nope, just me.    They tell me they got a complaint from some one that there were illegal drugs on these premises.  I then tell them, I know you can smell it, Yes I was smoking, I was working on my yard, came in , took a bath, rolled a joint, then I was interrupted by the Mormons, then they left, and now I am interrupted by the cops.  They then tell me if I know its illegal to be in possession of marijuana.  I tell them yes I know, but I enjoy smoking marijuana and have been smoking it every day for the past 25 years. I have never been in trouble with the law before. I am smoking it inside my own home and I am not harming any one.  They then go for thier handcuffs and tell me to turn around, I turn around and they place one handcuff on me, and thats then save came around. :)   The music ""Bad Boys"" from the COPS shows goes off on the television.  I start laughing, and coincidently they start laughing too.    I never felt the second cuff go on me.  Instead they turned me around and said, this is too funny, they uncuffed me and said, hey man, thanks for watching our show.  I then told them, Im not sure why, but I watch it whenever I have a chance.  They then said, he if your going to smoke marijuana, please make sure you smoke it inside your house only ok. Dont do it outside.   Then they were walking away and one of the officers turned around and said, "" Oh and one more thing, dont trust those mormons"".

Do_it_again11,4mnl41,"TIFU I am 29 and I am a Police Officer in California.  (throwaway for obvious reasons).  I am fairly attractive, very athletic and in great shape.  I get hit on all the time by women of all ages (and sometimes men) while I'm at work.

About two weeks ago, I was at work and went to a woman's house to take a phone scam report.  These are fairly common and don't take much effort on my part. The woman was in her mid 40s', blonde, green eyes, out of shape, but fairly cute.  She was really nice and a little flirty with me.

I sat down next to her on the couch and I started listening to her issue.  While Im taking down her information, I start to get an erection. I am attracted to older women and she is pretty cute, but my erection will not go away.   We were sitting down so it was hidden from her but I was trying to think of a game plan on how to stand up to leave without her noticing.

I was very turned on by this woman for some reason and near the end of the conversation, she says thank you and put her hand on my knee.  I feel myself start to cum in my pants, hard.  I let out a slight gasp of air and kind of crunch inward.   I was so embarrassed.

I panicked and stood up and asked her if I could use her bathroom.  I have a fairly large cock and it was impossible to miss once I stood up even through my awful wool pants.  Now my crotch was about eye level with her and she was staring right at it and said ""oh"" with a little smirk on her face while she pointed toward her bathroom.  

I went into the bathroom and assessed the damage.  There was a pool of semen in my underwear.  Now with all my equipment on, boots on and shirt stays, it was a fucking matrix of clothing to deal with.   I felt the most appropriate action was to get rid of the underwear.  I took my knife and cut off my underwear,  wiped them off as best I could and stuffed them under my vest.

Once I gathered myself, I exited the bathroom.  She was standing by the couch smiling, and I knew she knew.  So I sighed and said something to the extent, ""Look, I know this is incredibly unprofessional, but I was turned on by you and when you touched my knee, I ejaculated.  I am incredibly sorry and this has never happened to me before.""  My heart fucking stopped when I told her this and I hoped she wouldn't be furious and file a complaint.

She started laughing hysterically and said ""Well, for being (forty something) I guess I've still got it!""  We laughed for a few minutes and I ended up awkwardly leaving and hoped I would never see her again.  

I saw her again the next fucking day.  I ran into her while at a Starbucks coffee and I apologized again.  She said it was no problem and it was oddly flattering for her.   

TL;DR - As a cop, I ejaculated in my pants when an older woman touched my knee at a call, and I had to ditch my semen soaked underwear. FML.",tifu,TIFU by cumming in my pants in front of an older woman. [NSFW]
tophatmaggoo,2gdr3r,"Let's start by laying the foundation of this story. My coworker is a 38 year old, verified sex-addicted, very homophobic black man, and I am a 22 year old, white, liberal gay man. For some reason we hit it off the day i started work three years ago. I would even go as far as to say he was my best friend. However, i never let him know i was gay. That was going to stay a secret. For two years, no one I worked with had any idea. (I live in the Deep South, and I know for a fact that I would lose several friends if it came out).

About a year ago, he managed to get me to admit it. He lost his shit, but not how I thought. He was happy for me, kept saying things like, ""I knew it! I'm so excited!"" or ""You're still my nigga!"" Two days after I told him, he came up to me and (jokingly) said, ""I've decided, I'm gonna let you suck my dick."" I knew he was joking, and was the furthest from gay anyone could ever be. The number of women he has slept with is in the hundreds. I responded, still joking, ""I'll call your bluff. Let's go, right now."" This was at work, so we went out the back door to the 'ready yard', where we put our finished products. It is very isolated with no chance of anyone finding us. I knew he was gonna smoke a cigarette, as he did 3 or 4 times a day in that same spot.

What I did not expect was for him to tell me to get on my knees. I did (I've been attracted to this guy for years, not that I would have ever admitted it), and I watched as he pulls his MASSIVE penis out. This penis was the penis of the gods, making all other small, less divine dicks quiver in fear before it's glory. So i did what anyone would do in this situation. I gave that man the best blowjob he's ever had. After all was said and done, after i had swallowed and smoked a cigarette, we went back in. He wouldn't say anything but 'wow'. He informed me that that was going to have to keep happening. I wasn't going to argue.

Skip forward two weeks. My boss calls me into the office and on the computer monitor was a video playing of me going to town on my coworkers dick. I had no idea there was a camera out there, and in hindsight, realized it was pretty stupid of me not to count that as a possibility.

My boss started threatening me with my job, which I need, and implies that I'm going to have to suck him off to keep him quiet about the whole affair. Which, while I really enjoy giving blowjobs, was not how I like to be wooed. So i blew him. And blew him. And blew him. I was giving this guy 2 to 3 blowjobs a week for about 3 months in his office, hating every minute of not being allowed to say or do anything about it.

He got bolder and bolder with time, eventually giving me the ultimatum of letting him bend me over the desk or get fired and have everyone know about my being gay. So, out of necessity, i let him fuck me. It really was more like rape. I'll spare you the details, but it was not enjoyable. 

I was so shaken by the experience that i broke down after work that day and told everything to my coworker/friend with benefits. To say he was furious would have been an understatement. He started losing his shit, telling me how he was going to take care of it for me. Then a miracle happened. Two days later, my boss was in the hospital, apparently the victim of a mugging. He had three broken ribs, a broken wrist, and his face was barely recognizable. My coworker never admitted to doing it, but my boss quit two days later while still in the hospital and hasn't talked to either of us since.

Anyway, I fell in love with my coworker and we now live together, raising his 3 year old daughter together. And i still have my job.

EDIT: To clarify, I am not in a relationship with my coworker. He still won't admit he's attracted to me, and he'll die before he admits to being  in a gay relationship. I do live with him however, we have sex regularly, and I consider his daughter my own. I'm completely in love with him and am content with where we are.",tifu,TIFU by giving my coworker a blowjob under a hidden camera at work. [NSFW]

It washed down the drain, and I felt so alive, from that day forth I planned my mornings accordingly.

I decided that I would disguise the smell with coffee grinds, and sure enough it worked well enough.

I-Made-A-Bad-Choice,2ew8f3,"Oh **FUCK!!!!!!!!!!**

I am boiling with shame and humiliation. 

There is a friend of mind who I find attractive. So, what I did awhile ago was to print out some of her best facebook pictures. I kind of wrapped them up in plastic wrap and I affixed them all over my shower walls.

What I do on a daily basis, every morning when I shower, I am naked and surrounded by her pics, and I masturbate to them. (Sometimes *on* them.) 

It's just a habit. The pics have been up for months, so its to the point where I really think nothing of it at all. 

I had a little party at my house last night. It never entered my head to even think about the pictures on my shower wall. So fucking DUMB. 

To make a long story short, she was one of the guests. I don't know if she found it on her own or if somebody else saw it and told her, but all that matters is that she saw them. 

She came out of the bathroom with a few of the pictures, looking horrified and disgusted. My mind froze. It all clicked for me right then. I couldn't believe I didn't think to remove the pics before the party. 

Before she could even say anything, I ran out of my own party, out of my own apartment. I ran crying out the door and into the street. I slept in my car. 

When I got back in the morning everyone was gone, of course. 

I have a lot of unanswered text messages and facebook comments, which I haven't even looked at. I skipped work. I have basically settled into the idea that I am just going to get the fuck out of this town. Resettle somewhere else, start over. I want to hit the road this weekend. I can't face her. I can't face my friends and co-workers. Everyone knows. I need to start over. New town, new state. New people. 

I have been sitting here all night crying, jacking it to her facebook pictures like a pathetic fuckmop.

PartyBusJohnson,2nc788,"first, right off the bat, i just want to say that I do not have any mental issues or disorders to the best of my knowledge. though after the shit I just pulled, I may have fucking tourette's syndrome. Fuck me. anyway, let the shitstorm begin. Be me, 17, sitting with my 14 y/o bro, his twin sister, and my younger 12 y/o sister. We were eating chili for dinner, having the time of our lives, and things were just fine. 

Some background on the twin sister: she is an extremely bubbly person. I'm not saying that having a extreme positive look on life is a bad thing, I personally just find it slightly annoying. Idk if anyone else feels like that around people like my sister. I just feel like I'm in a family sitcom whenever I talk to her. And before you might speculate, I want to say that I never really feel jealous of her, and I do really like her as a person and sister. It's just that her personality can be irritating at times when there is nothing inherently wrong with it. She tells tons of very PG jokes that I just cannot laugh at or find humor in, one example being,""What's green and has wheels? GRASS, I was KIDDING about the wheels!"" Like, one little joke is fine, and I sort of would pity laugh it, as would everyone else. But then she would start telling 8 OF THEM AT A TIME. One after Another, until she was done, all being top kek humor in her eyes, while realistically they would all follow the same formula, ending with a pun, or just being RANDUMMmm and nonsensical in attempted tweenage shock humor (see example joke stated previously for context. you'll get the idea.) She also has an Extremely loud laugh. it's like a faster pace and louder alarm clock that ever so slightly stabs your eardrums from across the dinner table. On top of this she's also a very typical teenage girl, with all of the Starbucks and One Direction and uggs.  As a teenage dude who goes on the internet all day and has a taste for alternative music, we butt heads on alot of fronts. she also is a very sensitive person, and will genuinely feel sad if I try to point out the lack of humor in her jokes after the tenth one and i will get icy stares across the room from my parents. so yeah. that's her.

I think I just had a very in depth vent sesh with myself about some real issues I have with my sister

Anyway, chili. we're eating it. familydinner.exe is running properly. suddenly little sister brings up an instance from the past couple days that we all remember. it's slightly chuckleworthy. but for the twin sister it is enough to make her fire off one of her best earlobe-curling, shudder-inducing, eardrum-molesting shrieks of laughter.

 Idk if any of you have come across a person at school, or in the office, that just sneezes abnormally loud, EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY SNEEZE. they're not sick or anything. that's just the natural way they sneeze. and as they do it for the fifth time in five minutes, you just internally think to yourself, ""why the fuck do you sneeze like a fucking f16 taking off??! for fucks sake! sneeze normally LIKE EVERYONE- FUCKING-ELSE."" it's a very selfish and greedy thought, but it travels through your brain for a half-second. if this has been you, transpose those exact responses to someone laughing obnoxiously loud, and you're basically in my head at the moment of this happening.

And as it's happening my brother, who shares the same feelings about his sister as I do, turns to me as I turn to him, and we both share the same ""are you fucking kidding me?"" face with eachother, as we have countless times before when this happens. only this time It's different.  Little bro says to me, across the table, partly out of annoyance, and partly out of spite of twin sister, ""Hey PartyBusJohnson, what would you rather listen to instead of her laugh?""

at that moment, My mind must've just slightly snapped in a creative way. in the past, when having been asked this question by my bro, i had said things like, ""i'd rather listen to a paper shredder laugh,"" or, ""blood on the dance-floor, on loop,"" But this time...ohhoh...this time my brain said, ""Fuck it, I am sick of this fucking kids fucking loud-ass laughter. I'm fucking done."" and my Brain shut off all humor filters, including but not limited to: Family gathering settings, shock value control, human decency level, and most importantly, RESPECT-FOR-OTHERS. If I were to put a physical analogy to it, it was alot like when piccolo took off his weighted armor to reveal his true power level.  My mind charged up a fucking spirit bomb of unadulterated horror using the souls of John Wayne Gacey, Adolf Hitler,  and Vlad The Impaler, and fucking responded to my brother's question with, and I fucking quote:

""I would rather listen to my first born child getting brutally murdered with a baseball bat.""

IN FRONT OF MY WHOLE FAMILY. AT DINNER. WITH CHILI. 

FUCK.

Time began to move at a slower rate, space seemed to suspend itself, and I watched as the fucking diabolical, purely evil sentence entered each one of my family member's conscious. I watched their faces contort in horror and fear of what I had just created. then, after a few seconds the second wave of emotions hit each of my family members, differently for each one. For my father, it turned into a look of rage and shame, because he had just witnessed his first born child utter something truly disturbing to his beautiful innocent daughter, only in her fist year of high school. still full of life and laughter; the autumn of adulthood not yet cascading onto the beautiful summer of childhood.

for my brother, his face went from a look of fear to a look of what can only be described as, ""HOLY SHIT HE JUST SAID THAT"" 
[here is the best example I can find](http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1415835363483.gif)

And for my sister, It was a look of pure shame. A look of concreted distrust. A look that told me that no matter how much apologizing and begging for forgiveness I slew at her, and even when we were both bold old and grey and our years of preadolescent quarrel were behind us, In some corner of her mind of sunshine and happiness, she will know that at some point, I compared her sweet innocent LAUGHTER to that of the SLAUGHTERING OF A CHILD.
and it was at this moment, dear reader, that I knew, deep in side. that TIFU. And IFU hard.

Blackmajyk,8sbq27,"Obligatory this happened four years ago or so. I was 13 at the time—17 now. My best friend at the time had a hamster named Indiana Jones. Yes. Indiana Jones. The first day she had purchased Indie when we were around 10 or so, she picked him up out of his cage to pet and hold the little guy in his hand. Indie jumped out of her palm and fell about three or four feet onto the ground, giving himself a limp from there on out. While the original Indiana Jones didn’t have a limp—or was a hamster—we took Indie on many, many adventures. 

We would build obstacle courses outside and have Indie navigate them in his hamster ball. Construct massive tube mazes with treats hidden throughout them. Watch little Indie run on his hamster wheel. And on and on. The fun with Indie seemed like it would never end.

One fateful day, my friend announced that Indie was probably going to die soon. I was bummed. I guess when he fell and hurt his leg, he suffered some internal damage that would soon end his life. When the day of Indie’s death came and passed, my friend had put his body in a little cardboard box that we we’re going to take with us on a camping trip with a group of friends and a friend’s mom.

We planned to go on a 3-day trip where we could hangout, do some exploring, and have some fun. We didn’t want the trip to only be full of sadness and sorrow. At least that’s how I would have viewed it.

We were out in the middle of nowhere in the midwest. So it was dark. Dark is an understatement. It was pitch black actually. Our first night out when we set-up camp my friend's mom had freeze dried pre-marinated meat in a ziplock bag to make a stew with.

She asked me to grab it from the back of her jeep. She said it should be in a little cardboard box. I grab the box, pull the ziplock bag out, and dump the contents into our pot sitting on top of the burning camping stove in the middle of our campsite.

After everything had been cooking for awhile, her mom grabs some bowls and begins to use a ladle and pour the stew into bowls for us.

It tastes weird. Really weird. 

My friend’s mom comments that there are no bits of meat in her bowl, and we all look down and realize there isn’t any in any of ours. That’s odd. I was the one who put it in there.

Confused, I grab a flashlight and approach the pot. As I look down, right in the middle of the stew, I see the disgustingly dead and grossly cooked body of Indiana Jones. I scream and instinctively kick the pot and stove over, and then watch to my dismay as the contents of the pot spill all over the ground and the lit camping stove begins to ignite my friend’s sleeping bag on fire.

*TL;DR:* Had fun times with friend’s hamster,  hamster dies and plan to bury hamster on camping trip, accidentally put dead hamster into pot instead of meat, eat stew with hamster juices inside it, see dead hamster floating in pot, freak out and kick over stove and light friend’s sleeping bag on fire.",tifu,TIFU by cooking and tasting my friends Hamster

midnightsmith,327fg0,"So this actually happened today at my local starbucks, still trying to process it.  Let it be known that I go to this starbucks regularly, like every day regularly, all the baristas know me as do most of the other regulars.

Being raised the way I was I always hold open the door for the person following me out of common courtesy, sometimes the awkward hurried shuffle of the person ensues but they are always polite and thankful, until today...

On this fateful day I was in a bit of a rush but I decided to hold open the door for this young lady following me, mind you she looks like a normal university age woman, in good shape, dressing slightly fancy. I smile politely as I hold open the door and as she rushes in she immediately yells ""who the hell do you think you are? who do you think I am?""  Bewildered and blindsided by this I stammer out saying ""I dont understand, did I do something offensive?""  to which she promptly responds ""I do NOT need a MAN to hold a door open for me! I am QUITE capable of opening my own door! I'm not some frail little delicate girl who needs a man to save her, let alone help her!""

By now the entire place is dead silent, all the baristas stop making drinks and I'm standing there with my mouth open trying to process what the hell just happened.
I say ""Im sorry, I didnt mean to imply any of those things I was just being polite. I hold the door open for everyone"" to which she replies ""oh EVERYONE huh?! not just the cute girl who's coming behind you?  All you men are the same!""

At this point I realize there is no winning so I decided to say sorry again but then she keeps going ""THIS is why I'm a feminist! This is what you men need to learn! We are not a frail and in need of saving gender! We can take care of ourselves! "" 
I just shake my head but lo and behold here comes this older lady who was sitting with her husband.

Feminist girl looks at the old lady ""No! He should learn not to be so inconsiderate!""
Then older lady says ""Alright let me tell you something little miss uppity, in my day we called that chivalry and it was a good judge of a mans character weather or not he held doors open or offered his coat.  Nowadays you younger generation think good character is a man who has the most cash! Feminist has become a word women like you throw around to be nothing more than a bitch whenever you feel like it.

tifuthrowaway1999,36em1v,"Throwaway for obvious reasons..

Junior in high school here. Today I skipped school (I do it all the time with little to no repercussions) with a friend of mine, and we decided to go to my house so we could smoke some nasty ganja. Both of my parents work until late in the afternoon so this has never been a problem in the past.

We went into my room and started getting the joint ready. My buddy rolled it up (he's a pro!), and we were just about to go into the backyard to light it up when we both realize we don't have a lighter. My dad is a cigarette smoker so I figure I'll just head into his room and grab one and remember to put it back. I think you can imagine where this is going..

I walked in and there he was, totally naked and sprawled on his bed with a massive boner. But that's not even the weirdest part. He had printed out pictures of devil drawings put up on EVERY wall. There must have been 50 drawings. The lights were out and he had candles around the bed. And worst of all, he was wearing a fucking devil mask! My dad has always been a super mild-mannered guy and this was totally out of the ordinary. 

He saw me and I slammed his door and me and my friend ran out of the house as quick as possible and got out of there. I'm now at my friend's house not sure what to do. My dad has called me 18 times already and I'm sure as hell not answering that.

TL;DR - skipped school, walked in on my dad having a satanic jerk off sesh

hadagreatphysical,369qek,"I'm a guy. I was just having a physical and stress test on Thursday for a job that's very physically demanding. I meant to post this right after it happened, but it wasn't the weekend, I forgot, and I was just reminded again by a post I read. I'm so ashamed I'm gonna have to change doctors.

It might also make a bit more sense if you know that while I was getting ready to go to the appointment, I was trying to rub one out but stopped halfway though when I noticed I was gonna be late if I tired to finish.

Once I got there, I go into the exam room expecting my usual doctor (an ugly old woman), but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was a younger, very attractive woman in her late 20s/early 30s recently hired, and she would be the one giving me the physical. Unfortunately, my mind immediately started to wander, and I was totally checking her out the entire time she was doing everything else. I had semi-rection by the time it was time for that wonderful hernia check.

She closes the blinds and tells me to drop my pants. Obviously, I knew nothing was going to happen but I just couldn't help the way my mind was going. I feel like such an idiot typing this. Anyway, I drop my pants and she turns around looks down at it, then looks back up into my eyes. She probably wasn't smirking, but that's sure as hell what I saw. She squatted down and started off pushing around my groin area, then when she touched my balls, I had an immediate rock hard erection. I was embarrassed but she just looked up at me and said ""It happens,"" and laughed a little. She felt around a bit, and the warmth of her hand radiating through the glove, and the way her hand kept brushing the tip had me really edging close, as embarrassing as it is to admit, because it hadn't been very much time at all. It seemed like she  was about to stand up when there was a loud noise outside (turned out to be a car crash). Her hand glided across my penis when she turned, and I just couldn't stop it.

A huge load of cum shot out all over her hand and face. She was extremely angry, and when I apologized, she didn't say anything. She stood up, wiped herself off with paper towels and splashed water on her face. Luckily that was the last thing she had to do, so she just said to get my papers at the front desk and walked out of the exam room, leaving the door wide open, me rushing to pull my pants up before the footsteps I was hearing walked past my door.

IseeSuns,3pcc3n,"I know this is a little less dramatic than most TIFU posts but it's pretty heavy hitting for me.

My laptop is an Acer that was running an OEM windows 7. It was stuck in an eternal boot loop and I thought the HDD was fried. I decided to plug the HDD up in my friend's computer to run a diagnostic and it turns out the HDD was fine but something in the MBR was bad. At this point I have no disk image or recovery disk for my laptop. I decided since windows 10 was offering free upgrades then I'd just boot Win10 from a USB drive and perform a clean install, Activate it with my windows 7 key from the bottom of my laptop and be done with it. Nope. Apparently if you do a clean install of Windows 10 then your OEM Windows 7 key is worthless.

M$oft told me there is nothing they can do because I was supposed to do an upgrade from my Windows 7 with the little upgrade button. My laptop is out of warranty and I know Acer is going to charge me for recovery disks. I probably could have avoided this if I would have checked to keep my original files instead of clean install in the setup. I'm pretty pissed off M$oft doesn't actually warn people about this during the setup.

Now I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to roll back to windows 7 from my recovery partition without recovery disks....
 
Edit: After bitching for 2 hours just now they gave me a ""one time courtesy key"" for Windows 10. He wasn't supposed to.

Edit2: I saved the entire chat log.

Edit 3: I still had my original OEM key. Shouldn't that be enough? Shouldn't they mention that?

Edit 4: This is like my 4th or 5th chat session (I was very calm and polite on those might I add) with them. It's an easy mistake to make and they should be prepared to fix it. Was I an asshole to him? yes. Should I have had to be to get it sorted? no.

Ad_Victorium_Lenny,3vm09r,"At the time of my typing this post, it's been exactly one year since December 5th, 2014. The date marks the date of a very ""underground"" holiday. This holiday is Saint Nicholas day. I will spare you traditions but it's basically a miniature early christmas. I was surprised when I was gifted an RC quadcopter/ drone thing. Now, as a kid, I never really enjoyed RC anything. And considering I am much past the typical age for people to enjoy such things, I was just generally surprised to receive the gift. Well, I opened it up and fucked with it (because flying those things is hard as shit) and I sucked at it. Regardless of the fact that I couldn't keep the damn thing in the air for more than three seconds, I had a fucking blast. Well, later in the day I went to my local vape shop and hung out for a bit and met one of my buddies there. So me and my buddy went back to my place and were immediately struck with boredom. I then looked over at what would soon become the legend known only as ""Lenny the Drone"". We started fucking with it and slowly, a devious idea started brewing inside my head. ""Lets take it outside. Lets see how high it goes."" So we took it outside and had even more fun than before. After 15 minutes of laughing our asses off and feeling just like kids again, I said it. ""Lets see how high it goes"". We set it on the ground and pushed the shoddy plastic throttle all the way up. When the drone started going over the street as I noticed a car coming, I brought it back and set it down. I hadn't had enough. I set it on the ground again ready for phase two. As I screamed ""Full fucking throttle"" the quad copter shot into the air. Only it didn't come back. After it went about 3 blocks past my house, roughly a mile in the air, we started chasing after it hoping it would lose it's range. Poor Lenny was on a mission. He wasn't coming back. After 30 minutes of searching around my town, trespassing through others' yards, I started to hear the faint sound of moaning violins as ""Nearer my god to thee"" started slowly creeping from all around. It was over. My new found friend, was off into the late, cold night sky. I still think about Lenny sometimes. Whenever I look into the sky and see blinking lights, I think ""Maybe"". But Lenny must have had a greater purpose. Sometimes I convince myself he's off in Pennsylvania by now; couch hopping from hobby shop to hobby shop. Or maybe he was headed straight to area 51 where he belongs. Perhaps his owner gave him a pat on the head and a treat for finding his way home. Maybe we'll even see him on the next installment of ""Ancient Aliens"". Who knows. I will never forget Lenny, even if I know down inside, he is likely deceased.

TL;DR: I was gifted an rc plane, named him Lenny, he died a heroic death. To infinity and beyond.",tifu,"TIFU, because My Dear friend has passed today. His name was Lenny. And I killed him."
abdallakhalifeh,4my8g1,"Two of my friends and I had to stay after school for assignments we had to complete. One of us took biology, and so he had to do an experiment, where he raised bacteria under different circumstances in petri dishes, and record his findings. 

All was going well until the time came to dispose of all the bacteria, since my other friend and I were done with our projects, we decided to help our friend clean up. We went into the school bathroom, as our registered scientist claimed we needed to wash and clean the petri dishes before we threw them away, as the bacteria could spread or whatever. That is when we collectively as a group of moronic teenage boys fucked up.

We started grabbing all the different cleaning products we found in the bathroom, detergent, soap, bleach, you name it. We poured all of the cleaning products on the petri dishes at once, and the result was not pretty. We starting smelling a faint odour that we thought was just one of us letting one rip, and so we disregarded it and continued our educated cleaning process. It wasn't a minute or so later that the horrid smell became pungent and hit us like a sack of bricks. Unbeknownst to us, mixing detergent and bleach should not be done anyway, as it would cause a reaction. But when you mix that with highly infectious bacteria, you get an unholy concoction. 

We didn't just smell the gas, we could taste it, we could feel it eating at our skin. We immediately ran out of the bathroom and shut the door. But we couldn't just leave that in there, and we couldn't tell any teacher about it or we'd be in deep shit. We decided to continue our fuck up and take on this situation on our own. When we opened the bathroom door, there was now a thick cloud of gas that we couldn't see through. This should have been enough of an indicator to call for help, but we said nay. 

We ran back in with the objective of opening all the windows, getting all the petri dishes into a trash bag, and getting that trash bag out of the building. Everything was going to plan, I was opening all the windows while my friends put the shit in the bag. We were coughing our lungs out during the entire process. 

We got out with the tasks complete, only to realise that we were missing a man. We went back in he mushroom cloud we created to find our friend looking at himself in the mirror, reciting ""It's ok, I'm fine, It's ok"" over and over; he got high off the fumes. We quickly carried him out and put him on the ground, where he happily passed out. 

We still had a gas bomb on our hands that we had to dispose of. We ran with the trash bag to take it outside, leaving a trail of gas behind us wherever we went. We took the bag outside of school and put it in a massive garbage container. When we came back our friend woke up and seemed normal enough. 

At that point we knew we had to go to our biology teacher to know what the fuck we were inhaling and whether or not we were going to die. She told us what we created in the school premises resembled the mustard gas that they used in World War I, meaning spending any more time in the bathroom could have led to our deaths. She wasn't even mad, I think we was even rather impressed. 

TL;DR Wanted to help my friend clean up a biology experiment, ended up creating mustard gas and almost dying. 


Edit: After reading the comments, I’ve come to realize what we made was not mustard gas, but chlorine gas (there’s also a possibility of it being chloramine). I guess our teacher just told us that it was more like mustard gas because it’s a more known point of reference. After researching, I see our experience does certainly fall more in line with a chlorine gas explanation (a source I looked at: http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/chlorine/basics/facts.asp). It still doesn’t really explain my friend’s moment of being high, which I can see is a bit absurd, but that could be him suffering from a panic attack of sorts. 

Many are concerned about the safety standards in the school that allowed us to get into this situation in the first place, and they have a point, I probably should be concerned too. Bear in mind that this was after school hours when most of the teachers and staff went home, and this project that my friend was conducting was completely independent, so it was all his (bad) idea to wash the petri dishes in the school bathroom. Another point, the bathrooms may be different than the ones many readers may be imagining, as I don’t live in a western country, so would have wider basins, quite small of a space and usually cleaning liquids and products could be found in them.",tifu,TIFU by accidentally creating mustard gas in a school bathroom.
FingerCutOff,4gmsc8,"For a lot of years me and my pal Ringus (fake name) have this running prank where we yell ""Who got the most balls!?"" and then do something crazy and shout ""I got the most balls now!!!!"" 

For example a few weeks ago Ringus came up to me at work and jumped on my desk, went ""Who got the most balls!?"""" and then slapped his own face and yelled ""I got the most balls now!!!!"" That put the prank in my court. I had the next turn. 

As another example at Burger King one time I was like ""Who got the most balls?"" and I dumped my Coca Cola on my head and yelled ""I got the most balls now!?!?"" 

Well that's how it works. So anyway I got the idea it would be so funny if I really escalated the prank and ""won"". I was very drunk when I decided this. But I thought, in the long run, what is the big deal about my left hand pinky finger? Do I use it? Would the satisfaction and legend of the prank outweigh any benefit the finger itself provided? 

It honestly did seem like a good idea at the time. 

So when he gets home (we roommates) I called him into the kitchen. And I go, of course, ""Who got the most balls?"" I then pulled out this big ass kitchen knife, put my hand on the table, and slammed the knife right down on my left pinky finger. 

I was supposed to then shout ""I got the most balls now!"" 

But instead I just shrieked a loud weird noise and no words even came out. I have never felt such an intense pain. I was expecting it to hurt, but as it was just a pinky finger not very much. But oh god. It was so intense and so insanely painful. I just stood there shrieking with blood squirting out all over the place.  Ringus started cursing and screaming and finally he called 911. 

Anyways I am alright now but I only have 9 fingers. I am pretty used to having 9 fingers but I wish I had not cut it off. I didn't even get to deliver my punchline. And whenever I tell people I cut my finger off as a prank, instead of recognizing it is a bad ass move they see me as absurd, stupid, or brainless. My reputation is shredded. 

Of course, Ringus was very angry with me, and we are now friends again but we never do that prank anymore. 

I just wish I hadn't done it.

Instead, as soon as I walked into the room, I guess I clenched my ass the wrong way and the egg BROKE INSIDE MY ASS. All of the sudden a bunch of egg yolk poured out of my ass. My girlfriend was revolted and shocked and even screamed. 

I ran out of the bedroom and locked myself in the bathroom and shamefully cried about it. When my girlfriend tried to ask me about it I broke up with her. I couldn't stand the humiliation.

Throwaway678495,82vog8,"So unlike many of the stories here, this one did actually occur today. As with all great fuck ups I will be using a throwaway for obvious reasons. Anyway, I go to a university in the Unites States and a few weeks ago, I met a girl that was really nice. I should preface this by saying im a guy. We will call this girl R. So after meeting R and chatting with her for a little over the course of a week, I find out she is really cool and I finally get the courage to ask her name. I don't know why this was so hard seeing as I have a girlfriend already but who knows, guys are weird. So I find out her name, but only her first name. That will be important later. Now in my area, spring break is a holiday where students get out of class for a week, so needless to say, we are all looking forward to spring break next week, however I realize that I wont be able to talk to R for the week, so today I decided that I was going to ask for her number, not to get with her, but because she is great to talk to. As we are leaving class, I walk with her to her appointment that she has and we just chat the whole way. I get lost in conversation with her and before you know it, we are saying bye and as I'm walking away, I realized that I completely forgot to ask for her number, but me being me, I just decide that its for the best and walk home. Now I don't know why, but some part of me just couldn't leave it there. So like any aspiring genius, I turn to facebook, keeper of accounts for years, and look up her first name, keep in mind I had no idea how it was spelled, and only knew very little about her. So after a few searches of not finding anything, I decide that i will actually get the teacher to help me unknowingly, so I crafted a great plan to get this girls email/name. I email the teacher and explain that I found something that belongs to R and I need to give it back before spring break and ask if she could help because I dont know her last name or email, and wouldn't ya know it, the teacher sends back an email with R's name and email, so I instantly hop back on facebook and find her using this new information. I send her a friend request and a message and not too much longer she messages back and seems pretty happy that I found her, but she is curious how I did, so I explained to her about my genius plan involving the teacher and how I got her information...and she instantly says she is freaked out and blocks me and now I still have class with her for the rest of the semester.

Lloydthrowaway,29ttpg,"I was a very quiet kid at school. I had a huge crush on this girl, *Natasha. She was always into me, but I was very quiet to even talk to her. She always tried to talk to me, but I not only whisper, I end the conversation by walking away.

Fast forward 10 years, I am now a 24 year old manager at a local pub. I talk all the time, I am a more confident person than I was back then. But, I had a huge problem, still, I lacked experience in sex. I was a virgin.

Anyway, I met Natasha at the pub I work in. I haven't seen her in person since the last day at school and she looked as beautiful as ever. (We have been facebook friends though). She spotted me and came up and gave me a huge smile. I returned one and went to talk to her. I apologized for my quietness all those years ago and I promised to make it up to her.

We started hanging out for almost two weeks now and I can see from her, that she wanted to have sex. But I didn't have much experience. So I tried to sway away whenever Natasha makes a move. 

I live in an apartment with my close friend and roommate *Georgia. She has been a friend of mine for a long time, and we both always have each other's backs when one of us is down. Her boyfriend is a wrestler, who wrestles in an American independent company. So he's been gone for a few months. (I live in Australia)

Last night, Natasha dropped me off home after one of our hangouts, and Georgia, as always, asked me how it went. I told her straight out, I haven't had much sex before and I was afraid to suck in bed. She gave me a look and stayed that way for a minute or two. She came to, and asked if I had a condom. I told her of course I do. Georgia stood up and said, ""I'll teach you how to have sex, come in my room."" I immediately declined, saying it was a bad idea. She said, and these were her exact words,

 **""you want to fuck, I want to be fucked, so I'll teach you how to fuck.""**

She also said that me and Natasha haven't officially gone out yet, so it's no big deal. I gave in and went in her room. We fucked for about an hour, mainly going through a number of positions. I laughed so many times because it was pretty awkward. But after learning how to fuck, she wanted to be satisfied. So I fucked her as hard as I could, feeling amazed at this newfound skill I have. 

As I was going to town, I heard a loud gasp at Georgia's bedroom door. It was Natasha. She ran out. I quickly flew off Georgia and covered myself. I don't why Natasha came back to my place, but I assume to check out my place, since I told her that night to come over whenever she felt like. Georgia was very apologetic and comforted me, I felt so stupid to take her up on sex training.

Now I'm at home, trying to ring her and facebook msg her and no answer. I think I just destroyed what we could've had, all because I was a big douche.

Now this weekend we had relatives come down who i have not seen in almost 10 years,this is where my cousin comes into the picture. I'm 25, he's now 22. Put simply, he has grown into an atractive man. 

I went to bed early as I was running on three hours of sleep and had a 9 hour round trip  drive to pick up said relatives. Unbeknownst to me, when the time came to go to bed, he decided to share my bed. I sleep in the nude, he must not have noticed. 

As I mentioned, I'm a very horny guy, and I have not jerked off in a week and have not had a man in my bed in about 8 months. Feeling a warm body next to me felt very nice, and I immediately got hard. I quickly realized he is the type to have morning wood. 

I could not resist.
I reached over and started to stroke him. It was a very nice piece of meat. I felt him start to wake up and took my hand off. As I slowly pulled away, I felt his hand grab mine and put it back on his dick, moving my hand to pretty much say keep going. 
And so I did.

I looked over at him, his eyes closed, look of pleasure on his face. I went for it, I went down and started to suck him. It felt so wrong, but I was enjoying myself, and his hand on my head pushing me down told me he was as well. I wanted that dick in me, so I asked him.

He said ok, he's never been with a guy before. I quickly got on my back, reached for a condom from my drawer, and slipped it on him. He fucked me, and it gelt great. I had him pull out before cumming, I wanted him to bust in my mouth. 

I viciously stroked myself trying to climax at the same time. He came, so did I. I could tell he hadn't cum in a while either. It was great.

Sunday_Account,30ou7g,"This FU happened six months ago. 

I work for a company that is contracted out to do work for a federal agency.  To get this job, I had to pass a security clearance which involved some agency calling all of my former employers, my family, and even my friends.  I passed with no problem and about 6 months from the initial application, I started working.  

This job entails about 50% travel.  When we travel, we almost always go to a federal agency building, set up in a conference room for a few days, do our job and then go back to our main office.  The work can be tedious and boring but the pay is pretty good and I love the travel. 

Right.  One night at home, I'm doing some work on my laptop and I knock of a cup of coffee, it spills on my laptop and it gets fried.  

Because remote work is a big part of my job, a laptop is essential. I'm a cheap bastard, so I fire up the desktop, hit craigslist and find a Samsung ATIV with an I5 for $300.  All of my work was backed up to my external SSD as well as my micro-SD, so all I need is a computer that can accomodate each, which the Samsung specs say it can.

I e-mail the guy and he e-mails back after an hour.  I send him my phone number and we set up a meeting.  

I met the guy at a coffee shop.  He was shaky; I mean he was crackhead shaky.  He was well-dressed but someothing wasn't right about the kid.  I fired up his laptop, it booted instantly....I checked the HDD space, memory, CPU, etc.  Everything was fine.  

Creepy guy looked like he was in a rush so I did a speed negotiate with him and walked out the door with his computer for $250.  Yeah!  I saved $50.  

By the time I got home, the Walking Dead was on, so I watched it, drank a brew, and went to bed. 

The next morning, I arrived at work with my new laptop.  THANK GOD over coffee- I told my a few co-workers what happened and about my dealings and old laptop, etc.

Flash forward to right before lunch.  My supervisor calls our team in for a briefing on a new project at a new government agency.  Everyone seems amped up to head out and set-up and start working.

When we arrived at the agency, we had to go through a security screening process.  I didn't think anything of it.  Questions were asked and answered, phone cameras were disabled via software, and laptops were scanned and their cameras were disabled.  

The guy working on my laptop called his supervisor and then his supervisor called another guy and next thing I know I'm in a room with four guys grilling me on the content of my computer.  

I told them it was recently purchased and asked about 50 times what they found on it.  I was really shocked and nervous but pretty confident that everything could be worked out quickly.

Boy, was I fucking wrong.  

Next thing I know, detectives have me in handcuffs, my rights are being read and I'm shuffled off to jail.  

My charges were pretty serious- and federal because we crossed states lines.  No one believes my story.  As far as they are concerned, they caught me red-handed with illegal porn and I was going away for it.  

My bail was not set for THREE DAYS.  During that time, I contacted a lawyer who believed me enough to interview my co-workers.  The lawyer also had a PI track down the guy I bought the computer from.  Turns out the guy was a registered sex offender.

It took a month for all charges to be dropped and even after all that shit, it took an act of God to get the arrest record erased.  

To date: my legal bills are around $12,000.

Fratfuck,16tmhz,"So this was last week, only have the nerve to say it now...

So here I am, freshman in college, hot chick from class invites me to a frat party, FUCK YEA!

The night is going along well, were both drinking, flirting around, make out a bit, and she says: We should go upstairs and continue.

Damn right! I run upstairs, rooms are either occupied or locked, fuck! But wait! The bathroom is free!

So we go in there, lock the door, and start getting hot and heavy. Where at one point she says, you should fuck me in the shower, that would be hot.

Sure thing, we both strip, turn on the shower and go! Her leaning up against the wall, doing a bit of stand up doggy, where she says, fuck me in the ass. Drunk, and never done anal before, I say fuck yea.

Start it up slowly, but the water is not as lubricating as we thought, but then I see this jar of Vaseline, I ask her if she wants me to use that, yes she says. So I take a big glob and later it all over her ass and my dick.

Proceed with fornication, after a few thrusts I feel it getting warm, but kept going, then all of a sudden I can't move, she's asking what the fuck I'm doing, she's in agony, I'm in agony. I can't get out...

My hand is stuck on her ass, my dick is also stuck in her ass.

And it hits me. Somebody put some glue in the Vaseline. WTF!?!?

So here we are, two people, wet, still perched over doggy style, one full hand, fingers and all glued to this chick's ass, at this point my limp dick still glued in her ass, her screaming, pulling away, me screaming of my dick being pulled out.

Nothing in sight, no solvents, no nothing, nail polish remover? Nope, guys frat house.

So here we are, we dress up as much as possible, I have a shirt with one arm in, she has a shirt on, and we wrap a towel between us.

WALK DOWN THE STAIRS,  IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE PARTY OF 300 PEOPLE, with my dick stuck in this poor chicks ass.

We called an ambulance, and a little under an hour later, they showed up. They looked at us and tried to figure out what the fuck was going on. We explain the situation, and I must hand it to the Emergency guys, they wanted to cry and burst out in laughter, but didn't and tried hard to keep us calm, and tried to say with a straight face that this happens once in a while...

In the ambulance they used something to get my hand off her bare ass, and I was able to put my shirt on.

Get to the hospital, 7 hours, 7 fucking hours of both of us laying on our sides, doctors, nurses, students, the whole fucking city was there, taking pictures and you could just hear a roaring whisper.

They finally get my dick out. Blood everywhere, oh my god the blood.

She has to get an operation to close the wounds and clean up the excess glue stuck inside, and I had to get my foreskin removed as the tugging ripped a good chunk out.


I recently found out that there was super glue in the Vaseline because there was a guy who lived in the house who always denied fapping and they wanted to catch him red handed.

I have yet to speak to her again, neither of us were in class this week as neither of us can be comfortable for longer than 20 seconds.

TL;DR: Frat put superglue in Vaseline, used said Vaseline as lube for anal sex. Humiliation level 9000

HoodedDelinquent,4u8b6n,"I'm a straight guy who recently broke up with my first serious girlfriend. I was sitting on my couch talking on the phone to my friend. She tells me: ""You just need to try new things and get your mind off of her."" What instantly comes to mind? Getting fucked in the ass. Why not right? No but really I was repulsed by the idea but I completely embraced her 'try new things' approach. I didn't tell her, or anyone for that matter that I did this, but I looked on craigslist and found an ad, we talked, and twenty minutes later I met with the guy. He was in his 50's. Great. I can't get out of this now, can I? ""Sorry I'm not gay."" Wouldn't really work in this scenario. So I continue on, still embracing my friends idea. His friends were out of town so we went to their house, they had the worst AC ever. We take our clothes off and I'm soft as a pillow. He's even stroking it and doing his best to get me hard and my dick is rejecting it. Finally he starts sucking my dick and actually got it up, as soon as he took his mouth off of it, it would go down. So here I am, sweating and getting my soft dick sucked my a guy who reminds me of Ned Flanders. Finally I start to use my imagination to my advantage and I'm able to keep my dick at 60%. Now time to suck *his* dick. I've seen a lot of porn so I have an idea of what girls do, at least I think. By the way, as soon as I got down and looked his cyclops in the face my dick not only died down, it reverted inside. So I start sucking and doing whatever. Honestly that was the least gross part of the whole thing to be honest. As a straight guy coming into this, out of all the things you do in gay sex, that's the least gross. So after I got done he starts to lube his ass. Oh great, I'm fucking him. I thought I was trying something new. Oh well, at least I can quickly bust and get out of dodge, right? Nope. First off getting my dick hard enough to penetrate took probably ten minutes. And then once I was actually fucking him in the ass, I was so grossed out, I wasn't feeling pleasure. The whole time I was thinking ""Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew."" We went for like 20 minutes and I was nowhere near cumming. Finally I just said ""I'll suck you off and then we're good."" He didn't tell me when he was gonna cum. Guess where that went. Yep. I got dressed, walked outside, drove around a corner, and violently threw up into an empty big gulp cup I had in my truck. I didn't even have food in my stomach to throw up. I am never ever ever EVER trying anything new again and never straying away from girls. Guys, stay with girls.

ilovejarm,2ya9ig,"Hello reddit, I am new to you and new to English so bare with me. This fuck up actually just happened today so I just felt like spilling the beans while the crock pot is still hot, if you know what I mean. I am currently writing this from the ER and in my country we have a phrase, “a blind owl can still hunt” so I hope to make light of this horribly sticky situation. 

 Allow me to inform you of my past so you can better understand just what kind of person I have grown to be. I recently graduated from an EXTREMELY private school for medicine. Medicine for animals to be quite a bit more sharp and to the point. Schooling was very intense and I hardly had any time for a social life. Its by some sheer miracle that I met Jarm on campus. By the vending machine is where the magic happened and we still joke about it to this day and (hopefully) will continue to do so. I noticed something new in the machine, Gummy Nuts (apparently made by a very exclusive very local company) and instantly was intrigued because when you have a strict routine life like mine, its really the little things that melt your butter. Anyway I eagerly make my Gummy Nut choice and Jarm just stood there staring at me until she spoke the most romantic words of all time “so, you like Gummy Nuts huh?”. After that it was “text book” as you say it. The dinner, the dancing…the kink. You see I was relatively inexperienced when it came to sex with women. I could barely pronounce the word clitoris let aside have any idea of how to properly traverse the cave of wonders.  Fast forward months later and she has taught me well. Very well infact, if you watched us, you would think I had majored in Cave Exploration rather than animal medicine.

 So Jarm wants to throw some spicy sauce into our love making trough, and I pretty much go along with anything she wants because her cave feels like its lined with pure ecstasy and I just want to set up camp in there. She wants to blind fold me while she leads me through the house by me following her sexy voice. She called the game “Find the Whore”. Oh, I didn’t mention im also 100% naked and my flesh grenade was aiming and really ready to fire. This is where I make the fuck up. I open the door slowly after stumbling through the house for what seemed like hours with a meat cannon so primed I was close to just fucking the next couch I ran into. I feel my way to the bed and find her face. I started “wind shield wipering” her face with my salami shotgun and say in the deepest voice I can do “I found the whore”. What happens next was like something out of a nightmare film. Jarm didn’t inform me that her step mother was on holiday and staying in the room right next to hers. In my haste to go spelunking I didn’t notice I had entered the wrong room and introduced myself to the step mother of the love of my life by placing my balls on her chin. What made it worse then what you think was she didn’t yell at first, she just started crying. Abnormally large tears too! They streamed down her face and crashed into my testicles like salty warm waves. When she opened her mouth to scream, the hot dog just fell into the bun if you know what I mean. 

Already insanely aroused from early my throbbing rod erupted a volcano of the semen like a fire hydrant on a hot day in the field. I take off my blind fold to see the horrible mistake I made just as Jarm entered the room to see her step mom unwillingly play a different kind of blind fold game, she was blind folded by my semens. Jarm fell to the ground convulsing. My instincts kick in thanks to my schooling. I run to my travel bag to grab what I thought was human medicine but in my haste to save my love's life I accidentally grabbed the animal medicine I had from a ""hands on"" exam that I passed earlier in the day. She happened to have allergies to what I gave her so I had to rush her to the hospital.  Now I'm playing the waiting game and typing this out has calmed me down and I just had to share this while it was fresh in the oven. Hopefully Jarm is ok. I really want to make her a bride.

EDIT: Where my country is from, paragraphs are not as necessity. Hope it helps

dnjowen,36msom,"Obligatory mention that this happened a few years ago.

I was working in a big chain store pet shop - at any one time we had about 100 hamsters, 40 rabbits, 40 guinea pigs, rats, gerbils, etc. - and had worked 11 days straight, many of which were 14 hour shifts.

At the end of the work day I was taking home a rabbit that needed to be syringe-fed to stop it dying. Typically I forgot the syringe, and while the shop alarm timer was going I ran to the back, grabbed one from the cupboard, and tried to rinse it off.

The nearest sink was the one we used for cleaning out the animals, so it was permanently clogged with sawdust and hay and shit. On top of that the cold tap sometimes simply didn't run, even when turned up full.

So, I ran the tap, and nothing happened. Tired and in a hurry, I left that tap and used a different sink before rushing out.

I spent the night nursing the rabbit and trying to make it not die.
In the morning I get a phone call at 5am telling me to get to work as quickly as possible. I pull up in a taxi and find water pouring out of the front doors.

Inside, dead animals are floating down the aisles in several feet of water. Hamsters have pooled in little clumps like spent teabags, while the corpses of rabbits and guinea pigs bumped around our ankles.

When I left the tap on there had been no water flowing. But shortly after I left it started gushing into the blocked sink and quickly flooded the entire shop.

At least 200 animals drowned. It caused thousands of pounds worth of damage.

I never confessed to my boss that it was my fault.

The only animal that survived was the sick rabbit I needed the syringe for in the first place.

formerredpillguy,36210b,"Throwaway because I  purposely locked myself out of my other account in an attempt to prove to my wife that I changed. 

My divorce became final today. I am still sad/upset/numb over it. 17 years of marriage and 20 years together. Gone. All because of the stupid things I did. Last year I felt I was in a rut. I felt emasculated and not taken seriously at work. I fell in with the red pill subreddit and the guys from the blog return of kings. I began to believe the crap they spewed because of the advice/promises that I would be a man again. This meant changing things with my wife. According to them all women are the same (but don't you dare stereotype men) they are not intelligent and have contributed nothing to society ever in history. The have disclaimers on the red pill subreddit that posts about beating and raping women will be deleted, not because it wrong but because they don't want to draw negative attention to the sub. I fell for their lies. My wife was good to me and never did anything wrong. I subjected her to the garbage on that site, including taking the money she was using for night classes because I got it in my head that education and careers for women are a waste of time. Other ideas like women should not be allowed to vote and women are only good for a pump and dump that I found on the site found their way into my house. I also began to believe the hypocrisy that if women don't put out in the first dates they are frigid but if they do they are not worthy of relationships. All of the things I have mentioned here can be found in writing on the red pill subreddit and the return of kings blog and no one tells people off they post stuff like that, they agree and parrot the garbage. Now I am alone in our (my) empty house. Everything is just like when she left except that my wife and my daughter are gone. My daughter saw how I treated my wife and refuses to see me. I know I have no one to blame but myself. I was accused of being a troll by the red pill guys when I changed my tune but now I just want everyone to know how poison they are.

TIFUThrowaway19,3xgn14,"So, I've gotten a boyfriend recently. He is very nice, nice enough to make me want to see the latest Star Wars with him. In preparation for this event, we've been rewatching the films. Last night was Episode VI, which we both thoroughly enjoyed. However, once the film was over, we did have other things on our minds, and ended up in his room to *ahem* clear such things from our minds.

Now, it has been a good two years since I've been in a relationship, so I did want things to go slowly, i.e., nothing beyond kissing for now. After some time, it became obvious just how attracted to each other we were. It was becoming more difficult to stick to the only kissing rule, and we both knew it. We said we should stop before things got out of hand... and carried right on. What could possibly halt the mood?

As it turns out, Star Wars and my big mouth could. While we were happily making out, we were also making Star Wars jokes. I compared how we were in danger of going too far to turning to the dark side. Once we started down that path, that was it, etcetera.

Boyfriend (jokingly): ""Search your feelings, you know it to be true.""

An intrusive thought is an inexplicable urge to do something completely moronic, like throwing your phone off a bridge, or breaking something fragile and expensive. One such thought popped into my head, and I voiced it like the moron I am.

""You're my father?""

I didn't just kill the mood. I fucking murdered it in cold blood. I'd found the one way to stop us going too far and executed it more brutally than Anakin did those children.

PinkandPurpleStuff,2qr4yj,"This happened yesterday afternoon.

not long after i get there and I'm thinking i would like a sandwich and milkshake, those munchies were kicking in pretty hard so i get my food and have a seat in the food court. it was pretty crowded there and there were lots of teenage boys as it is school holidays. i saw a teenager boy sitting by himself a few tables away so i turned towards him and pretended i was looking at my phone while i opened up my legs just enough for him to see my pussy. it didn't take him long to notice and he went bright red in the face and had a nice long stare LOL. after a few seconds i turned away but i did see him get up and go to the bathroom. i knew what he was going to do in there and it turned me right on knowing he was going to jerk off in the public toilet thinking about me. a few minutes later an older guy sat down in the same chair and i thought to myself what the hell that i should do it again. 

i turned the same way and opened up my legs a bit while i was looking at my phone. the guy looked over and saw me but he didn't seem to be embarrassed like the last guy, in fact he got up and started to walk towards me. i started to get freaked out so i got up and started to walk away, leaving my half eaten sandwich behind. i was walking through the food court and glanced over my shoulder and the guy was right behind me! my heart was racing, i didn't know what was going to happen. i heard a voice say ""excuse me miss"" and i turned and he was there holding out a police badge and he asked me to go with him. I was scared out of my mind as he led me to the security room of the shops. we went back to this area that was like an office and he asked the security guard if he could use the office as he had to have a talk with ""this young lady"" as he called me. he shut the door and then told me how he suspected i was flashing people on purpose and that if i was ever caught doing it again that i would be charged with indecent assault and locked up. 

i was absolutely terrified and started crying telling him i didn't do it on purpose, that i was sorry, that i would make sure it never happened again. he said i should go straight home and if i was going to come back that i should wear some underwear under my skirt.

Well, I just bought a new box of Magic Erasers and I knew those puppies were good for just about anything. When I followed the instructions and got the Magic Erasers barely damp, they didn't work for shit. So, I got them extra wet and squeezed some of the Magic Cleaning Juice on her arms before I scrubbed. Letting the chemical do it's job and sit on her skin wasn't really working. My daughter was screaming and crying and no matter how hard I scrubbed, the marker wouldn't come off. Her arms just kept getting more and more red so I stopped.
After she washed her arms off, she cried for 20 minutes and my wife put ice on her arms and said she was bleeding.
""What? I just used Magic Eraser.""
""You idiot! There is nothing magic about Magic Eraser. It is pretty much a microscopic scouring pad. There are no chemicals.""
""What is the white chemical you see when you add water?""
""That is part of the sponge itself. Little microscopic pieces of sponge, floating in the water.""
""Whatever.""

 It 2 am in the morning and I am walking home, after spending my Saturday night at the local bar trying to forget the shitty week.
Street in pretty much deserted ,as I live in a small town, but I see one lowly figure in the distance laying in the middle of the road. Get closer, it's a girl passed out. Her skirt has been pushed up and panties removed. I think she has been raped,so I have to help her now.


Check her pulse first,alive, then to wake her up to no avail. Take my phone out to call for help, only to be surprised its dead. Try to find some identification on her but she has got no hand bag or anything. Search in the surrounding area but to no avail.


I think that either I can drag her to the police station which is quite far away. As I am not going to find anyone driving at this ungodly hour. Considering I cant leave her to run home and call the police. I cradle her in my arms and carry her to my home which was about 5-6 minutes away.


Reach home, throw stranger on my bed. Stupidly decided not to call the police, thinking she needs the sleep. She can be on her way in the morning. 


Set by bed up on the couch and try to sleep. Cant couch very uncomfortable, decided to pop a sleeping pill(bad idea). Wake up to find my hands,feet and even my eyes covered in duck tape.  
Get startled, try to move but captor tells me to stop or she will slice me open with a kitchen knife.


I stop and ask her, ""who are you?"" She says ""quiet you disgusting pig"". She proceeds to bring my pants and underwear down to my knees. Place the blade on my manhood and yells ""where is my handbag"". Fearful of the consequences I say stutter""I..I.... d....don't kn..ow, I wassss....was jussssst trying too help""

""What by fucking me when I was passed out and stealing my handbag"".

Then I feel the cold stainless steel starting to press harder on my manhood. "" Miss I don't know you were passed out and laying exposed the middle of the street. I tried search for you ID but i couldn't find your bag. Couldn't call the police because my phone was dead. Decided to bring you home an"".""Quite!, If you wanted to help me you could have called the police when you reached you home!. Since you clearly knew I was raped but you wanted to continue what you started at you home!. I will take from you what you hold most dear, so you can never harm a women again!."" 


""But why wouldn't I then lock...ufffff"".She gagged me mid sentence.


Then I felt I pain like I have never felt, it was equal to a thousand needles going into my fingernails.She had slowly started cutting my man hood from the base. I yell as hard I can but not a soul would hear my muffled screams.She yells ""Feel the pain every time a women feels when she get raped, feel her burden, feel her suffering!"".

Then I hear a door crash open before I pass out from the pain. 

What happened during I passed out:
Neighbor outside walking with his son to play cricket(similar to baseball in someways, you have a big wooden bat in it too). Hears a women's screaming coming from from house. Run to investigate. Dumb bitch didn't close the window blinds. Neighbor sees whats happening from the window. Crashes door open. Yells at her to stop, she doesn't, just keeps on cutting away. Seeing their is no time to waste, he hits her as hard as he can with the bat on the head. Breaks the bat, knocks her out. Whisks me to the hospital and calls the police.


What happened when I woke up:


She had cut about 1.5/5 of the way in but stitches saved the day. After that a lengthy investigation  by the police followed. In the end they found sperm stains another man on her clothes and I was removed from any suspicion. She got 5 years jail time for her doing.


Summary:
Brought home a women exposed and passed out in the middle of the street home with no ID or hand bag.Mobile phone dead and didn't call police when I reached home with her.She sleeps on my bed, I on my couch and pop a sleeping pill because I cant sleep. Wake up hand,legs and eyes duck taped. She thinks I raped her and stole her money. Try to explain get gagged, the she proceeds to slowly cut my manhood off with a kitchen knife.

We always like to joke around with the new people so I told her we couldn't work while there was live electricity and it would be faster for us if she would turn the power off by finding a wire and bending it, like you do when you want to stop water in a hose.

Well you can see wear this is going. After I got back to work I didn't think anything more of it until stuff came over the radio and an ambulance came. New girl had actually gone and tried to bend a wire. I didn't kno she would take me seriously. My boss had told her never to go onto the site unless she was told it was okay and to wear a hardhat and her boots and not touch anything unless she was told it was okay. She actually thought I was being serious. She was wearing her normal gloves and no electrical safety gear.

[deleted],2aad6p,"The wife and I were getting intimate this morning and I was feeling a bit goofy, as well. As a joke, sometimes I will do the ""car antenna"" where I will turn sideways and pull my erection to the side so that when I let go and swing my hips around it will swing back and forth back to center quickly like... Well, a car antenna. 

So, she and I are fooling around, I'm standing next to the bed, crouched down and kissing her body. I stand up for a moment and say ""Sorry, I don't know why I wanna do this..."" and wind up for the car antenna, putting a little extra swing in it. I let it fly and... *crack*!

My wife was thinking that I had meant I wanted oral when I said ""I don't know why I wanna do this"" and had sat up and leaned in to do it. It hurt me a lot, but immediately she starting sneezing and screaming crying so I didn't have much time to whine. I had broken her nose. I then had to drive her to the emergency room, while she's yelling at me, crying, ""What the hell is wrong with you?!"", ""God, you're such a fuckup, sometimes"", ""What, are you 12?!"", and so on.

To make matters worse, we had failed to get our stories straight to explain to people why she had a broken nose, missed work, why mommy has something on her face and two black eyes, etc. This evening her sister showed up unexpected, wanting to speak to her privately. She asked my wife if I had beat her. When my wife told her the real story, she initially was skeptical, and even after entertaining that it was possible, she asked, ""Are you sure it wasn't an accident?"" (Worth mentioning that my wife competed in Taekwondo through college age, so any domestic abuse would end very badly for me, but whatever...) I guess, some people in the social circle have been talking, as well, but I don't think she is comfortable telling friends/family (aside from her sister) the truth. I know I'm not.

Goofygrrl,2lm71e,"Today I fucked up. Actually, This year I fucked up. Not even in the wildest imagination could I have imagined where I would end up. It started with the perfect job. I lead position, a big salary, they moved me and my family across the nation and got us set up in the best schools. I became nationally recognized in my field, I was a go-getter and it was all starting to pay off for me. I was thankful for the opportunity and I thought I had finally made it. This was the American dream. 

It ended up with me in a coma. 

I don't remember the month before the coma or the month afterwards, I suppose I should be thankful for that. Being on a ventilator really screws up your memory. I know I was working more than 240 hours a month for my job, looking at my schedule later, and that didn't count the off the clock time. The last picture I sent from my cell phone was to a friend of my lunch the previous day: two Monster energy drinks and a salad. It was taken at my desk surrounded by paperwork. God I was a fucking cliche. 

On my eighth day straight of working a 12 hour shift, I had a sleep deprivation induced seizure. That is what the official neurology note says.  I have no history of seizures, I didn't have any significant medical problems. What i have been told is I hit the tile floor so hard I split my head open, but the sound of the crash at least got someone's attention. I was without oxygen and blood pressure for a significant amount of time, according to the medical records. I seized for five hours, despite all the medications they gave me, and eventually was put in a medically induced coma. Later that day I had my heart attack and went to the cardiac cath lab. Then my kidneys failed. 

Before you dismiss this by thinking I'm old, I'm only 37.  I graduated top of my class from graduate school. I run marathons and squat 210 pounds at the gym. And I gave everything to the job. Weekends. Nights. Time with my kids. Time with my family. I wanted to be top of my game and Be debt free and I wanted to make a name for myself. I did everything that was asked of me. I gave that job everything I had. Those fuckers didn't even send me flowers. 

Now I have a traumatic brain injury. I have severe post concussive syndrome. I take anti seizure medicine, I have chronic headaches, I have a pill box that rivals most 80 year olds.  I had to send my kids away to live with my mom because I couldn't take care of them by myself. Why was I by myself: because my boyfriend left me. He couldn't handle that I went from being the bread winner and beautiful woman at his side, to trying to live off disability and having a Frankenstein scar up my forehead. 

I fucked up: I have 218,000 in student loans and I don't know if I can stay working in my chosen field. 
I fucked up: the mind I spent my twenties developing,  struggles with simple tasks and remembering words. 
I fucked up: the hot body I spent developing in my thirties aches in countless ways and I'm afraid to go running by myself in case I seize again. 
I fucked up: I chose the younger guy who didn't hesitate to walk away when I was no longer his sexy sugar mama. 

But I fucked up in so many ways before this happened. I fucked up by prioritizing my job, my work, over everything else. I had the voice in the back of my head telling me to take a break. Telling me that I was on the wrong path. I wasn't happy and I thought I could buy that happiness and it would make up for all the late nights. I fucked up by not spending time with my kids because I always thought they would be there waiting for me. I put off my entire life because I thought after I became the boss, made the money, married the hot guy, bought the big house and became everything I wanted to be that I would just ride off in to the sunset. I fucked up because I bought The American Dream on credit and now I can't afford the bill. I fucked up because I thought I would have more time to be the person I wanted be and now I'm so damaged it may never happen for me. 
Don't be like me. Don't be a fuck up. Don't give it all to a dream job or a career. Don't think that you have more time. Don't fuck up your family and your friends loving something that doesn't love you back. Just don't. Because between you and me, there were a lot of beds in my ICU, just waiting for someone else to fuck up. ",tifu,"TIFU: I took my dream job, and it destroyed my life."
StevenTheSloth,3p5lfb,"Ill keep this pretty short.

So im a pretty successful masterbator; when I say that I mean ive successfully jerked off in bathrooms while in middle/high school, the bathroom at my jobs, and yes even a few times I have beat my meat while on my way to work in the morning.

This morning was like any other day; the only difference was I was forced to take the highway because ironically it was the back roads that had traffic at the moment. So I hop onto I-70 (im from Denver) and all of a sudden I start getting my morning wood and crave a release. 

Let me say that, while I have jerked off driving before, its usually been in slow driving situations..never going fast. Well, fuck it I say, and I give it a go. 

Things are going fine at first; I have a pretty dirty stream of thoughts coming which should help me get it overwith fast. Maybe five minutes into the action, I look right and theres an SUV driving right next to me; and the driver is looking DIRECTLY at me. Its a cop. 

So heres what you'd think have happen next right...cop pulls me over..gives me indecent exposure etc? Nope, none of that happened.

Basically, right as I saw the cop I freaked out and put my weiner back through the hole in my jeans; but as I looked back over I see him laughing his ass off and as I look further I see hes actually driving with a partner and they are just both bursting out laughing. They pulled off the next exit and I feel extremely embarassed; no more highway jerk offs for me.

Anyway, I pick her up, I'm stressed because I was late and she is angry for the same reason. We're driving back home which is about 45 minutes away from where she works and she is in a bad mood looking out the window so I'm just cruising along.

So today I was on my holidays in Reading and I was staying in my aunt's house, she was out at work and both my parents were outside chatting in the back garden, my brother was beside me on the sofa. I saw my opportunity and took it, I ran out to the kitchen and filled myself a glass of water and mounted the stairs.

I'd spilled a small amount of water but I figured I'd clean it once I was finished. So I climbed the stairs and went into the bedroom and y'know, did the deed and left. As I was coming down the stairs I completely forgot about the water 3/4 of the way up the stairs, I was texting my friends and I placed my foot in the water and you guessed it, slipped...

[deleted],2vb5x9,"About 5 or 6 years ago, as high school student, I worked in a small, family-owned grocery store. It was located just a few minutes away from my home, and all of the neighborhood kids worked there. It wasn't a bad job, but it wasn't a good job. Just something we all did to make some extra scratch to pay for beer and gas. 

The store had a large walk-in freezer which was located off-site (about a 1/2 mile down the road). It was here that all of the meat, ice cream, and other frozen goods were stored. It was my responsibility to take the truck up the street in the morning, fill it with the necessary items for the day, and stock the smaller freezer inside the actual store.

I always liked going into the walk in freezer, especially in the summer. It was only about 4 or 5 degrees Fahrenheit in there, and sometimes I would go hang out in there for a couple of minutes to cool off.

One particular evening, just a half an hour or so before CoB, I needed to go and grab two or three pies that had been special ordered so I decided I would take my jolly old time and walk to and from the freezer. No truck required.

I strolled up the street, propped open the freezer door, and entered as per usual. Now, as a young teenage boy, I often got curious. Would my pee freeze instantly to the ground? Who knows? So I whipped it out, letting my little willy bear the cold. I wanted to just pee a little, but it was freezing so nicely to the floor. Might as well let it all out.

Mid-stream, I see a flash of light from the corner of my eye. The freezer truck, which I had neglected to use, is pulling up to the front door? Or so I thought. I got the fuck out of there through the rear door and sprinted away. I had actually pre-maturely clocked out before I remembered I needed to take a trip to the freezer so I sprinted straight home.

I had forgotten more than just the special order pies. I left the freezer door wide open. It turns out that I was just skiddish and bolted for no reason. The freezer truck hadn't been moved. The lights were just from a car passing by.

The next day, we were called into a work meeting. The freezer had remained open all night. $10,000 dollars worth of meat had been thawed out making it illegal to sell. AND, the owners daughter was getting married the following weekend and they had been storing all of the food for the wedding in the freezer. I had ruined that too. 

None of the managers knew who had gone up to the freezer as only one of them was on shift, off site, in the office. I never fessed up to it, and I never got caught. The lock had been broken on the door for a while so they assumed someone broke in at night.

Fuck them.

1) How organised religion is ruining the world and should be eradicated.

2) How all brown people should be shot.

I'm somewhat of a classical liberal, one that believes in freedom in all aspects of life first, then ownership of capital, so of course there's going to be an ideological conflict here.

I reply to that with ""those people were members of the english defense league, basically a bunch of Neo-Nazi Soccer fans, do you prefer Nazis to Muslims""

I decide, foolishly to ask if he has any sense of sympathy for people escaping conflict in war torn areas by living in Australia, he says no, they'll bring the conflict with them.

i ask if he has any sense of empathy at all, he says 'empathy is a human construct, it's not necessary for a society""

At this point I'm incredibly frustrated, ""Empathy and shared respect and understanding is what makes us human, you fuckwit, it's why human rights and war crime tribunals exist""

StarTrekCupcake,68kw2l,"  So this happened a couple days ago. To start off, I'm 17 years old, and similar to most 17 year olds, I have a big erm... appetite;). So me and my girlfriend had just taken a shower together and had been having a ""little fun"". Eventually when the water got cold, we proceeded to keep it going outside the shower. We tried the counter for a bit, but it was awkward because we're both kinda tall. So what's the next best option? Ahh, the toilet! I triumphantly sat on the seat with the lid down, and my gf hopped on my lap. We start going at it, and getting pretty into it. 
  Now let me say, this toilet is 14 yrs old. It's not the most sturdy piece of equipment, especially for this kind of use. Well as you could probably guess, 200+ pounds bouncing up and down on a porcelain object won't turn out great. As I leaned back to enjoy the view and moment, my girlfriend really went for it. This caused the tank of the toilet to crack right down the middle. I felt a nice refreshing spray of water down my back as I leapt up from the seat, butt naked and rock hard. Water was gushing all over my tiny bathroom! I slapped my hand over the crack, trying to hold all the water in place (I'm not smart). This resulted in me slicing my fingers across the tips. Fuck. 
  I immediately turned off the water supply valve underneath the toilet and secured the float in place. By this time, 3/4 of the water in the tank had drained right onto the bathroom floor. All of our clothes and towels were sopping wet. I grabbed every towel in the house and tried to soak it all up. This worked for the most part, but as you know, water is wet and very slippery. It went beneath the cracks of the bathroom floor and seeped into the actual flooring of the house. It also leaked onto the carpet, further soaking my precious floorboards. This fiasco basically forced us to call the insurance people's handy man to rip up all the flooring in the bathroom, the carpet in the hallway, and the carpet in the adjacent bedroom. This turns out to be over $1000 of damage.
  I called my mom and told her that I was gaming on my phone and slammed my back against the toilet bowl. She has no clue about any of the sexy times, and she never will. I fucked the fuck up Reddit. Ps: I haven't been able to shit in my own bathroom for 3 days.

OldenWorld,2magsw,"So I attempted to submit this a couple of weeks back, but the fuck up was deemed TOO fucked up by most readers (which I thought was the whole point of this Subreddit?), and was downvoted into oblivion as a result. Half didn't believe me, the other half didn't WANT to believe me; though I can safely assure you this is true:

So I'm a nail biter. I'm always biting my nails, whether I'm at work, at home, masturbating, in the bath, playing video games, I'm always biting my nails. So one evening (I believe it was a Saturday) I'm sat at my computer playing Battlefield, when my arsehole starts ringing with this most almighty itch beyond comprehension. Any more itchy and it'd probably have just automatically prolapsed to relieve the pain. So as a result, I let go of my mouse as quickly as you can yell ""wriggling anal worm"", inserting my index finger straight into the unknown depths of my sphincter.

Now for anyone who's not well-versed on anal worms, people who bite their nails are far more likely to contract them. A vast array of dirt, germs, and god-knows-what can linger on the underside of your nails, and as punishment for biting them, worms are born! So I'm sat on my chair in an awkward position, vigorously fingering myself in hopes the itch will subside. Once I'm done, I release my finger from my anal cavity, and bring it towards my face. As suspected, amongst a couple of curly hairs on my fingers, are these two or three miniature white penis-shaped specimens going about their business. This isn't the first time this has happened, and being the filthy, lazy bastard that I am, I simply shrug it off and wipe my finger on the underside of my computer desk.

Fast-forward to a couple of weeks later. Here I am again, sat at my desk; eating pizza (or something equally unhealthy). I manage to drop a slice of pepperoni on the floor, and hastily scramble to pick it up. So I bend down whilst still sat at my seat, gripping the side of my desk with my hand. I pick the slice up with my other hand, and proceed to eat it. Shortly after, I begin to play video games again; when I begin to feel this 'presence' on my finger. At this point I've got bullets flying past my head, explosions going off nearby - all of my attention is on the action in front of me.

This is where I make the worst mistake of my life. One hand's on my mouse, shooting at enemies in the distance, and the other hand has just been inserted into my mouth. I absent-mindedly scrape off whatever's on my finger with my teeth, and... bite down. I hear this crunch, and immediately I know what it is. Time slows down, I gently take my finger out of my mouth, and observe the half-eaten worm resting on my saliva-covered finger.

I jolt upwards, lean out of bedroom window and almost vomit attempting to rid myself of the other half of the worm currently resting on my tongue.

I was in school having fun, and I felt like making fun of Hitler. So, as I was bored while eating lunch, I decided to draw a quick sketch of Adolf Hitler. I drew him as good as I could in a matter of 5 minutes, and I put swatstikas all over him. Because I drew it quick, it was pretty sloppy. Now I have to think of something. Bingo. I'll put tits on him and make him look gay, then call him gaydolf titler. I drew tits on him, and then tried to make him look gay. I made his smile look as gay as possible. Then I put lines in his hair for maximum gay. Then for the hell of it I drew people saluting in the background, a concentration camp, money coming out of his belly button, all while holding a shekele. I then drew Jewish stars on tents, and I fucked one up. I'm bad at drawing symbols. This is where the fuck up begins, lunch is over, I put it in my backpack. I forgot about it for days. Well it turned out I slipped it into my report, and I was scanning Gaydolf Titler into a report accidentally. Alls good, all papers are scanned and I put them into a USB. It was report day. I had to show a slideshow of my report to the whole class. All going normal, until I show Gaydolf Titler. I then explained what I thought was the slide was. ""Here is the total conclusion to my report.""  People laughed. I was confused, teacher was angry. I look, gaydolf. I was expelled from school after that.

rcwpro,2lob7k,"Like most TIFU moments, this didn't really happen today, but a few years back. I was 14, freshman year in highschool. A tough year for both my girlfriend and I, whom I'm still currently with. Okay, so on to the fuck up.                                
      So her and I were hanging out after school. We didn't get much alone time at home due to our age and parental discretion, so we took initiative and hung out in the cross country trails for about an hour and a half after school. All was going well; making out, some groping, all the good teenage stuff. Then... The fuck up. She was wearing a skirt, which was great for me. I proceed to reach my hand under her skirt and she lets me, with pleasure. I move her underwear over and continue fingerblast the shit out of her. After a few minutes, I stop because we heard a rustling in the leaves around us, which turned out to be just a squirrel. I then assume the position again and when I go under her underwear, she feels SO wet. Like, unnaturally soaking wet, which is fine with me, right? So then I continue for a bit, but stop again due to the same reason as before. Then we talk for a bit about how she likes what I'm doing, etc., then I look down at my hand with terror. Oh fuck, there's blood. Everywhere. All over my entire hand (it ran down due to gravity). I tried to make sure she didn't notice so she wouldn't get embarrased, to no avail. It worked for a few minutes, but she then went to hold my hand and BAM! She notices immediately. She then proceeds to cry and I wash my hands in the tears. And that's all folks. Have a good day.

[deleted],355xdv,"Today, I received my HATRED t-shirt, which I received from pre-ordering HATRED the video game online.

I'm pretty excited about this game. I do on the other hand find it tasteless and rather stupid, totally over the top - but none the less most likely fun. And definitely important to freedom of speech, creativity and the game industry which I work in.
Spit in the face of all the ignorant people who try to censor the industry and block creativity and freedom. 

enough rant about that, as it's a heated debate. but this game feeds on all that ignorance and is the result of censorship, ignorance and stupidity surrounding the industry.

Now. I received the shirt this morning, I put it on instantly and went on with my day thinking that it just said HATRED on the front.

Today I was going to an X-ray at the hospital (broken foot) to check if it was healing correctly.
I sat in the waiting room, playing poker on my phone.

I went in to the examination room and had my x-ray done and the doctor asks after the procedure is over, what kind of t-shirt is this? 
""it's rather ""angry"""" as she put it.

I laughed a bit and explained the shirt, the game, the industry and that I work in it, and she laughed too and understood.
She then pointed out that the shirt said something on the back of it!!!!!!!!!


""NO LIFE IS WORTH SAVING!""
It says on the back.

So, there I was, in a hospital. In a ward, full of injured, hurt and sick people, with this message!

I felt pretty black metal!!!

So obviously I go over to it and drag my finger through the dark paint, and proceed to draw a penis on a white section that had already dried (I even added some drops of jizz coming out).

YesIknowImessedUp,2js4ji,"Let me start with some background information. I have certain fetishes (that I will not be getting into) that are not being met in my marriage. Some of them are a little extreme and, embarrassing but I just have to indulge in them occasionally. I have tried bringing it up with my husband, but he isn’t wired that way and is very happy with vanilla sex. I love my husband and since we get along like a house on fire in every other way, when he proposed, I said yes. I keep myself happy by exploring my fetishes by myself and occasionally online. 

Right, so onto the Fuck Up. Occasionally, I like to go to a certain sex chat website, try and, find men with the same fetish for some cyber sex. It is not often that I find someone compatible. About 5 months ago, I met an older man (I also prefer older men) on this website who was into exactly the same stuff I was and he was really fun to cyber with. Once we were done, we decided to keep in touch for next time we needed to *play*. We both created fake Skype accounts and continued to chat there. He was in a similar position as I was, married to a woman he loved, but she wasn’t sexually into the things he was into. 


Over a period of 5 months, I have sent him photos of my privates, (just my privates, no face), with and without certain *toys* and he has sent me photos of his junk almost every time we have chatted.  

Last weekend, we decided to move things up a notch and voice chat for the first time. We started text chatting as usual, and once things started heating up, we moved on to voice. It was all going really well, and, I was having a wonderful time until he decided he needed me to see him *finish*. 

I was initially excited by the idea and he turned the video on (I did not; I like my privacy, thank you very much). I was expecting him to show me only his manhood, but apparently he didn’t mind me seeing all of him. He turned the video on, and, there was my father in law going to town on himself. I stopped speaking mid sentence and logged off. I don’t think I will ever be logging back in again. 

I don’t speak or see my in-laws often, just a couple of days around Christmas and we speak on the phone on birthdays. But I don’t think I will be able to ever manage doing that ever again. There is absolutely no way I can even look at my father in law. I’m still in a bit of shock but I’m pretty certain my cybering days are well and truly over. 


**Edit**: 

* Regardless of what all you saints think, I will not be telling my husband about the F-I-L part of the FU. I may tell him about the cybering at some point. He is aware of the fact that I have kinks, and that I *help myself* occasionally and that I watch porn. I know he does too and I have no problems with it what so ever. Maybe my morals are lower than most redditors or maybe I have a more pragmatic way of looking at things. 


* I do not feel guilty, nor do I consider this cheating. I have certain needs, and I have a safe and much necessary way of meeting them. To get a divorce or leave him because I have a need for an orgasm sounds to me, like the equivalent of burning the house down because my dining chair is a wee bit uncomfortable. 


* As suggested by a few comments, I will however be sending an offline message letting my F-I-L know that it wasn't him. And that I'm done. ",tifu,TIFU by realising my kinky cybersex partner of 5 months was my father in law. NSFW
mastermight9,5ymdci,"As like all other fuck-ups, this did not happen today, rather a few years ago when i was 16 and a halfish. Being that age i had rather large amounts of hormones raging through me and so i would reguarly ""pump the pedal"" to whatever enticing imagery i could find. My family lived in a relatively small house at the time so i had to wait until everyone had gone to bed to get my happy time going.

During that day i had read somewhere about the money that could be made for sperm donations and since i was a poor little bastard i figured i could use my mini-me's to make some quick money.
Moving back to the night and i've just finished my business on my bedsheets on the right hand side (idk why i did this i just found it the most noiseless way of doing it, gross i know) and would promptly fall asleep from exhaustion. Come morning the gooey stuff had dried and become a white powder like substance, I would harvest this into one of these glass jars we had (basically just scrape it off into the jar) and store it back under the clothes in my drawers. Repeat this nightly for about 2 months and i had an almost full jar of whitey salt like powder.

Anyway the Fuck up comes when im about ready to cash in my dried mini-me's. I moved the jar stealthily into my sports bag(which sits in our hallway next to all the other bags, shopping included), ready to sell these bad boys down at the sperm bank tomorrow.

A few hours go by and it comes time for dinner. Mum has put on a great spread, roast chicken (my favourite), and as i sit down i notice a certain white jar full of a white salt like powder in the centre of the dining table. This is when i realised that the jar of our normal salt and my ""special salt"" are the same design and style and i don't think its the normal salt sitting on the table right now. I asked Mum where the salt came from and she replies that she ""found it amongst all the bags in the hallway from the afternoons shopping trip.""

So, i frantically ran through all the excuses i could think of in my head to try and get the not so special salt off the bloody table but to no avail, all the while sweating like a pig and looking redder than fresh tomato soup. Mum gave me a quizzicle look and told me to stop being weird and eat my dinner, and i did just that, with no salt added. However i did sit there quietly eyeing my family members with a growing sickening feeling as i watched them lightly tap, tap, the salt jar onto their meals and happily gulp down potatoes with sprinkles of dried salty me with not a care in the world.

I never got to sell the leftover sperm salt as i later found it it needed to be fresh, I'm an idiot.

kinda_alone,275uyz,"Hi guys,

I hope post-default life is treating you all well. We feel like the sub is headed in the right directions. That being said, we have had some controversial posts recently, so the modteam and I have decided to add some additional rules.

* First of all, all posts involving obscene sexual situations, such as, but not limited to, incest, minors, and assault, will be removed. For example, posts like today's involving [this drunken incident](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/273iyw/tifu_by_getting_so_drunk_that_i_made_a_serious/) will be removed in the future. A post such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/274rpb/tifu_by_having_sex/) is acceptable since it involved a consensual incident between two, unrelated, adults.

* Second, posts relating to causing the death of someone and suicides will also be removed. We feel that these stories are difficult to verify and are sensitive topics. The comments in many of these stories can also get completely out of hand. If you or someone you know is suffering from depression and has suicidal thoughts, or if you know someone who has recently taken his or her own life, /r/suicidewatch[1] is a more appropriate place for help. At this moment, any post resulting in the death of someone will be removed. These are rare and not many examples exist, but you should be able to understand what we are talking about. 

* Thirdly and on a slightly less serious note, we need to discuss your bowel movements. While there is always the occasional gem, the vast majority of the ""Today I Shit Myself"" genre is unamusing, unoriginal, and probably made up. Starting tomorrow, we going to have a two week ban on these shitty posts. If you need an example, feel free to looks at the tifu frontpage; I am sure there are several. 

We are making these changes because there has been an influx of these impossible to verify stories.  Redditors involved engaged in some VERY controversial topics, which puts the modteam in uncomfortable positions. Posts such as these create unnecessary drama. 

Finally some housekeeping matters. Please keep in mind that OP knows he has fucked up; that's why he is posting. There is absolutely no need to remind OP how wrong he was or how he fucked up. It discourages quality posting, it is a distraction from the entertainment this sub is supposed to bring, and finally, it just makes you seem like an ass. Also, please remember that the posts do not technically have to be from today. You do not need to comment reminding OP that the subreddit is called ""Today I Fucked Up."" Please let us know about any suggestions for the future, and remember to message us anytime you report a comment. 

Thank you and continue to fuck up, 

The modteam

P.S. Next goal is to have a more consistent fuotw

nowitburns,3i4dyv,"My friend and I decided at 1:30am that a fourth meal was absolutely necessary.  We had been drinking since 1pm and what better way to end the day, right? So, we ordered some Dorito tacos, a burrito, and a quesorito all with plenty of Fire Sauce.  We opted out of the Cap'n Crunch balls (we're really watching our weight). 

We're back at his house, tv on, and a delicious meat/cheese/tortilla cornucopia in front of us.  I, myself, had never tried the Fire sauce before and concluded that while delicious, it's not too terribly spicy.  Yum!

We finish eating (yes, we ate everything) and were left with a stockpile of leftover Fire sauce.  

""Let me lick this Fire sauce off of your asshole."" He says to me. 

The Fire sauce on my tacos did not taste spicy to me at all in my mouth, so why would it be any different on my asshole? ""Sure."" I responded.  

I pull down my jeans and underwear, bend over the couch, and present my asshole for condiment application.  

""I can't believe you're letting me do this.  I think it might burn."" He said while reaching for a packet of Fire sauce.  

""It's not spicy, dude.  It's fine."" I said.  I was pretty down for this idea. Why not?

He opens a packet and drizzles the sauce on my asshole.  He takes a few moments to empty the entire pack along my ass crack and asshole, basically covering the entire asshole region. (Said dude wants me to mention that he was very careful not to let any sauce run down to my vagina).  With a few licks, he cleans the Fire sauce off of my ass.  That was that.  I stand up and pull my pants and underwear back up.  

Within a matter of minutes, I realized that I had made a huge mistake.  The burning sensation upon my asshole came on as if a semi was on fire and drove right into my rectum.  I then find myself on the floor in pain yelling ""It burns! It burns!""

I run to the bathroom and tear off my pants.  I didn't necessarily have a plan of action when I got to the bathroom, but it seemed like the appropriate place to be in the moment.  My asshole felt as if somebody inserted a freshly cut jalapeno suppository into my butt.  

""Pour some milk on it!"" I demanded. 

""I don't have milk.  I mean I have expired milk.  Do you want that?"" He said.  

""AAAAHHHHH! IT BURNSSSS!!!!"" 

""Hey, try putting this on it. It's diaper rash ointment."" He said as he handed me a tube.  I put a small dab of ointment on my hole.  

Nothing.

""IT BURNS!! HELP ME!!"" I begged.  Meanwhile, the dude is laughing at me as I dance around with a fire breathing poop hole.  

""Try these baby wipes...but they have alcohol in them so it might burn more.""  

I tried the baby wipes.  It burned more.  

He brings me an ice cube and suggests I rub it on the area.  I tell him to do it for me so I bend over the counter as he starts rubbing the ice cube on my ass crack.  This was something I needed to do myself, I decided.  I sit down on the bathroom floor, sans pants and underwear, and start rubbing this ice cube on my butt.  This was the answer!

My dude friend sits down on the floor with me, asshole and ice cube in view.  Apparently, the rubbing of the ice cube on my ass inspired something in his pants.  The next thing I know, he whips his dick out and starts jerking it.  

""Does it turn you on how much pain I'm in?"" I ask.  

""Fuck yes."" Was the response I got.

I rub the ice cube on my ass until it melts away.  The pain had definitely subsided.  I put pants on and we went to bed.  

We definitely did not expect to find ourselves on the bathroom floor, me rubbing an ice cube on my fiery asshole while he jerked off.  

Today, I'm not sure if it was the Fire sauce that I consumed or the Fire sauce put directly on my asshole, but I definitely have some fiery poops today.  

Never again.

throwaway194333,c834og,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I’d break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I’ve even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&amp;#x200B;

This progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady’s second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I’d spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn’t enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked “why are you buying all of these boxes of staples”. But I brushed it off as a work issue that I’d get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn’t know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&amp;#x200B;

This past Thursday after one of my “late nights” I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying “what are you talking about” until my mom said “honey, we saw the pictures”. Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me “do something” with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was

&amp;#x200B;

""I...I like staples.""

&amp;#x200B;

The WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn’t laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&amp;#x200B;

Believe it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a “staple hour” once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.

EDIT: 

Thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find &amp; watch it out of pure interest of other people’s perspectives on my problem.

1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.

2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn’t think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn’t think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it.

Adam_Tarmac,c9kxx6,"This happened in the Oughties. TL/DR below.

My (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don't know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

We had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

However, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)

On my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.

Here's where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can't say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principal since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn't want to be in more trouble so I just yelled

**""HEY LET ME IN!!""**

The entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

Now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and I'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard in my life said

**""GET ON THE GROUND!!!""**

There was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! So whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought I somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, I don't know. He did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. He grabbed me up and took me to the office.

The rest was a huge blur but essentially I was not punished for THAT, but I got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. There was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. Parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

Laziy-Beans,c9exoy,"The other night, I was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.

Now, as a kid, I remember reading the Ugly Duckling - and for some reason, I completely misunderstood it. Not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. The reason being that it was, of course, a swan.

But for some reason, I got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. Instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, I thought that swans were just male ducks. For some reason I never stopped thinking it, even though I’ve seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. I don’t know why it never got through to me. I guess I just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.

What this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, I scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that “you can’t have female swans”. I stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised I wasn’t kidding.

stuffedwithpretty,c8t4bn,"So I was in the shower shaving my legs. I was going quickly and carelessly, when I felt a sharp pain in my foot and noticed I had cut myself. Thinking it was nothing, I shouted for my sister to get a band-aid.

I WAS WRONG. SO, SO WRONG. The blood started gushing by the bucketload, and it wouldn't stop. The shower looked like a crime scene. My sister came in with the band-aid, took one look and rushed to get a medical kit.

Luckily, she has first-aid training and knew what to do. But there was so much blood. It spilled onto the floor when she asked me to come out and sit on the toilet lid so she could treat it, and I was naked too. Even though we're both girls, I still felt a bit uncomfortable.

She ended up spending half an hour just getting the blood to stop. The whole time I was trying not to panic. I'm prone to panic attacks, and this was freaking my the fuck out. Especially since the room now looked like someone had been murdered.

Eventually, the blood did stop, so she bandaged up my foot and we started to clean up the room. But of COURSE that's when my dad wanted HIS shower. We told him not to go in because blood, but he insisted he could clean up during his shower.

He must have underestimated the sheer volume of blood though, because he had a mini heart attack when he saw that room. He did keep his word and cleaned up, but he was stunned.

I later cleaned my razor and found a MASSIVE chunk of skin lodged in there. No wonder there was so much blood!

About three months later I only got a reply from *one*, stating that it wasn't the kind of stuff they're looking for right now. Cool, I scrapped the book and took it as me just not writing the right stuff.

Turns out that another publishing house replied after about 4 months basically saying sweet, contact us regarding further detail and we'll make shit happen together.

I'm a 21 year old trying to get a career in banking. An opportunity came up for an unpaid internship in Singapore. I thought, who wouldn't want to spend a few months in Singapore? New alcohols, criminally cheap massages and Asian food.

The fuckup started when the time came to speak to someone. Leaving the airport I flagged a cab and spent about 5 minutes trying to communicate where my apartment was. It turns out Singaporeans speak 'English'. They know English but they speak it with such a heavy accent and so much slang its indecipherable to a piece of uncultured white trash like me. I've gotten really good at the smiling and nodding technique whenever someone questions me.

It turns out Singapore is ranked the most expensive city to live in the world (via Time Magazine) and there are no cheap massages. I knew it was a major city but I figured there would be some places on the outskirts that were more affordable. I spent the first week eating nothing but McDonalds (thank god the holy arches are all over in this damn world) until I found this little rice/noodle stand that will sell plates for a few bucks. The first day the old Chinese lady who mans the stand thought she could scam the dumb American but after 5 minutes of animated bargaining I got the price down. Way better than McDongholes.

The company I'm interning with apparently ran out of space in their main office so they plopped my ass in a dinky little satellite office. The first week I did some work on a project for them that apparently they didn't like because I have not heard from them for two weeks. I sent a few emails and texts to my contacts (who are at the main office) who just said there is a lot going on for them atm.

To make matters worse I found a friend from America a few days into the trip and we had been having a good time trying local bars out and attempting to flirt with local girls in the evenings. Well a few nights ago we had a bit much to drink and decided it would be a good idea to take a dip in the fountain outside our apartment. After a few minutes of fun, a patrol car flies up and a pair of officers jumps out yelling at us in what might have been English. I booked it without thinking, nothing but my sopping wet boxers. I tried calling my friend after the incident and legitimately have not heard from him for 3 days now.

So now I'm stuck on the other side of the fucking world, no idea what I'm doing here, no real job, the only source of sustenance is a chinese lady with a grudge and my only friend is presumably rotting in a Singaporean dungeon.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I took an internship in Singapore, can't understand anyone, my company ghosted me, and my only friend was taken by the cops.

Edit 1: Yes everyone. I realize I'm an uncultured American swine. If there are any local girls willing to educate me, I'll be at the local mcdonalds.

throwaway16x,c9240b,"Obligatory-this happened in the last 2 weeks

One of my friends (17M) was talked about how he wants a girlfriend again a few months ago. I was the patient listener, and very open when he asked if I knew any ""cute girls."" I thought it was a strange talk for us to have considering the fact that I disagree with his frequent encounters of the bedroom kind with various girls, but nevertheless I kept my eye out. 

Then about a month ago, one of my friends (17F) mentioned she had a massive crush on my friend (after she'd seen his picture and watched him play football). This was perfect! He's attractive, she's attractive, it totally worked on the superficial level. All I had to do now was to introduce them. The chatted over text (she doesn't have social media at the moment)and they met up two weeks later. I don't generally endorse the blind dating thing, but I hoped it would work out. 

The official date happened about 2 weeks ago. They went to a little restaurant around the corner from her high school. She texted me immediately after, saying it was great. They'd ordered food, walked around, and in typical behavior, he initiated and they made out. I just assumed everything went well. The next weekend, they hung out again. That is, until she called me afterwards crying. She told me that they'd been talking and she told him she thought the date was going well and he had replied with something along the lines of ""Ehhh, I don't know. I've had better."" laughed and then ""Because, lets face it, you are fucking disgusting. You're so ugly. I don't know why \_\_\_\_\_\_ paired us up, I mean, I'm leagues ahead of you. If I'm not getting any, it's not worth it. I'm not gonna fucking marry you."" and then left. I was so shocked, I thought she was kidding (spoiler alert: she wasn't) I texted him immediately and asked him what the hell he was doing. He told me that he didn't care how she felt because she should have know he was out of her league and he only wanted sex. and that he hated her eyes because ""it made her look asian"" I wasn't expecting it but it made me really angry and stupid for pairing them up in the first place.

 (of course I couldn't know how much of a racist dick he was because he's never acted like that before but still.)

I get that he is definitely the worst in this situation, but still. I paired them up and she's still upset about that. I feel fucking terrible for the way he treated her

VeniVidiVigor_,c8lj2o,"!!*** Making an update of the r/TIGFO page 7/5 2 am********** !!









I’m a bartender. I’ve been working with the same people for a couple of years now (the two people I’m about to talk about got hired at the beginning of this bar opening with me.)
Like i said, it’s been about two years. These two girls have been an incredibly HUGE part of my life ever since. We have pretty much been inseparable since we became friends during opening.

Today, I worked a double. I opened, There’s always just one person during the day shifts, and that was me today, and I was SLAMMED. it’s summer break (we are a bar arcade) so I didn’t get to stock everything I needed to to prepare night shift. At 5:00, when my night shifters got to work, instead of taking a break, I took that time to finish the things I couldn’t to prepare night shift fully. And then instead of taking a break after that, I went ahead and got back behind the bar and started working because they were busy, and I couldn’t leave them in the weeds.

To finish up, we got our asses kicked, after my 12 straight hour shift with no break, I finally was cut, so I did my side work, and before I was ready to clock out, I went to our till, ready to do the three way split (since the way we do things, we just take the entire place and split it), and a bunch of credit card tips were missing.

To summarize, my co workers had tried to hide over $150 in credit card tips to try and not split with me. And I am so fucking upset, my heart felt like it could explode, and I’m pretty sure I just lost my best friends, but also, fuck both of them.

TL;DR, My bartenders/best friends/co workers tried to steal over $150 from me after I worked a 12 hour shift today and I’m fucking upset about it.



***************


Holy shit, this blew up. Hi, Reddit! I have a couple updates to questions I saw, but first want to say thank you to everyone who is showing me support and giving me some really good advice. I had a good nights rest and time to cool down and think more rationally about what conspired last night. 

***Update 1: Yes, I did get my money. This was after I had noticed when I went to do the split that there were multiple credit card payments missing their tips, which you can enter in at anytime. (Side note, it had been about an hour before we entered in any more tips because we were actually pretty busy focusing on other things.) and for my fellow bartenders, we split tips after all your early out shit is done, because we still talk to bar guests while doing it. 


**Also yes, I did confront them and ask them why they both did it the second I figured out what had just went down. Neither of them really wanted to face the situation. So i took the hidden credit card tips and split them three ways and fucking bounced.


**Also, lmao, I’m a girl. 


**As for the cash tips, who the fuck knows. They could have swiped some of that too, but I’ll never know. 


**The three of us are gonna have a meeting about this after a long group chat message I sent just between the three of us. I’m gonna basically let them explain themselves before going straight to the owners and hopefully communication can be handled in a more positive light moving forward.

**I was scheduled to work after my morning shift as a double. Everyone was well aware of that. I’m getting questions as if I just voluntarily stayed to eat into their tip pool. Hell no, I was scheduled to open and then work an early out night shift. 

I will update after our meeting.


***Update 2: So I want to clarify on a couple points before i talk about the meeting, I’ve been asked “are you 100% sure they tried to actually hide this money?” And “don’t jump to conclusions so quickly” so let me explain very clearly- on the right of our register is a cup we get credit card slips in that have NOT been entered into the computer. On the left of the register is a cup of credit card slips that HAVE been put into the register. At the time it was ready for me to do the split, the credit card slips that were in the cup on the right were gone. When asked about it, I got pretty much no response. I’m not an idiot, and there are really only a couple of hiding places behind the bar, so I lifted the register and found the hidden/unentered credit card slips, and mildly flipped the fuck out because I’m also not trying to make a scene with a full bar behind me, because god forbid one of us have an ounce of professional courtesy left in our bones.

**I also want to let everyone know that I have read pretty much all of these comments and have taken everybody’s advice to heart and I can’t express my appreciation for that enough. 

Okay, so, I’m going to refer to these two co workers “M” and “K”. M was the one who texted me after I had left work to try and apologize and somewhat explain herself. I didn’t text her back immediately because I needed a minute to not say things that could hurt me or quite honestly, hurt her as well. I wanted to talk about this seriously and rationally. 

**The next morning (yesterday morning), the first thing I did was call my boss. I told her everything, and I sent her screenshots of the text messages M had sent me. I called a meeting between me, K, M, and my boss all together. I got to work early, and M had actually gotten there right around the same time (also showing up early) and K worked yesterday morning (which I completely forgot she had to open, so fuck me), but when I got to work, I saw K, and she walked right by me in the parking lot not saying a word to me. Also not coming to the meeting. So that’s super cool. 

**So, my boss, M, and myself all sat down in our back office and had a long chat. Now I just got to work (I closed last night, and had to open today. Clopens are the best. /s) So I will be back to update some more after I get home and my shift is over. Just wanted to let everyone know that I’ll still be updating you, probably for the next few days.

TL:DR at the bottom.

This FU is more so my parents than mine, but I definately had a part to play in it. 

It all started 2 nights ago. My parents were having guests over the following day for lunch, and asked me to fill up the water tank. Since it gets loud when the pump drops water onto the water below it, I filled up the water somewhat high, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

All is well and I decide to call it a night.

I wake up the next day to both my parents telling me about the miracle that happened after I fell asleep.

My single fish is a small Cory catfish, and anyone familiar with them knows they often dash up to the surface for air. 

Shortly after I went to sleep, my parents walked near the tank to see my fish on the floor. Since I just filled the tank, they figured he must've jumped right out and onto the floor. My dad thought it was a wrap, but my mom decided to put him back in, in the slight chance of a miracle happening. 

They wake up the next day to see him swimming around like usual.

What a relief... The little guy must've put up one hell of a fight.

The following day my parents are telling their friends who came over about what they did and how amazing this miracle was.

Fast forward to 15 minutes ago. I come home from my friends place and decide to feed my fish before sleeping as I always do. I see something on the top of the tank hidden in the corner... 

The fuck is that???

My heart drops and I'm shocked. Did he die because of the trauma he must've had from being out of the water? 

I look closer and I see what looks like my fish curled up on his side, but I decide to look at the bottom of the tank in a small battleship I have for him anyways to confirm. 

I see him inside. What a relief... AGAIN.

I look back up. 

The fuck is that then???

I inspect it closer. What my parents so ""miraculously"" saved was in fact a chilli pepper. My FU? Not noticing sooner. I must've noticed about 48 hours after the pepper was put in. The pepper was soggy and curled, giving the appearance of what could be a fish. My fish has been swimming in chilli water for 2 days. All I can hope is that he'll be okay. Changed a bunch of water and made sure the water condition is better.

TL:DR... Filled up water tank since it got low 2 nights ago. Parents saw my fish on the floor an hour later. Decided to put him back in the tank anyways hoping for a miracle, only to see him swimming around the next day. Fast forward to today and I see what looks like a dead fish, only to realize what my parents ""saved"" was a chilli pepper. My fish was swimming in spicy water for 2 days.


Sorry Mr. Foshie

Edit: Thank you to everyone letting me know about him needing tank buddies. I actually had another one recently but he unfortunately passed away when I was moving homes. I will definately be heading out to my local fish store to get him some buddies. Thanks again, guess that's my second FU.

So I eventually left my room and went to go apologise to my mom for seeing me like that yesterday. She kinda cut me off and just told me the normal ""It's natural for boys to be doing what you were doing, there's nothing to be ashamed about, do it in the bathroom since you don't have a lock on your door, etc""

She then asked me why I was on the ground, so I told her I fell off my bed mid-nut. (Which is something I never thought I would say to her.) It seems like my mission debriefing with mission control was a success, she was not aware of my space flight.

I don't think I'm going to be living this one down anytime soon.

I'm gonna have to be more careful, and wait for her to not be home before going on future space endeavors.

As we all know the venn diagram circles of ‘birthday’ and ‘hotel room’ overlap at the point known as ‘weird kinky fun times’ so I packed accordingly and decided to surprise my gf with a 9inch suction cup dildo amongst a few other items.

Anyway we had our fun and spent the rest of our time pranking each other by sticking the dildo to as many funny places as we could. 

The ceiling, the tv so we could laugh every time it would line up on someone, and finally the bathroom sink.

The next morning my gf was taking birthday selfies and posted them on Facebook 

This morning she received this message https://imgur.com/a/DR36kaT from her mom.

Apparently a lady at her moms work was looking through our lovely birthday photos and happened to spot something peculiar in the background of the hotel room and brought it up to Gfs mom. They were all talking about it at work. 

Gf told her mom I had bought it as a joke and that it was left in the hotel and never used.

My girlfriend quickly deleted the picture but we have no idea how many people saw it 
Hopefully thanks to the never ending fuck up that is Facebook, the picture glitch yesterday saved our skin but who knows

coldhearted-bitch-or,c8xtnu,"tw: sexual assault, obviously

So my family goes on one vacation every year. It’s always been my mom, dad, brother, and me, but this year my brother’s bringing his girlfriend too.

I was raped my freshman year of college. It took me a while to even call it rape; it wasn’t until this March, a year and a half later, that I even said the word “rape” out loud. Obviously I never told my parents because I didn’t even know that was what had happened (I mean I knew what had happened, it just wasn’t until I told the story to my therapist and she was like “you know that’s literally rape right” that I put 2 and 2 together. Anyway.) So as I’ve grown more comfortable with it and calling it what it was, I’ve been talking about it more. I told my current boyfriend about it. I told the girl that was with me that night what had actually happened. Just hadn’t told my mom yet. We have a good relationship, it’s just hard to say those kinds of things to your mom sometimes.

We flew in last night. Today, at dinner, sexual assault happened to come up, as I’m part of an organization at my college that works with a resource center. My brother, being the stupid idiot devil’s advocate he is, decided to bring up the “why not just fight back” thing and his girlfriend was like, “yeah, if I ever found myself in the situation, I know how to defend myself.” Here’s the thing - I did too. I’m very capable. But in the moment that it happened to me, it’s like I was frozen. I’ve been dealing with a lot of that guilt, with coming to terms with the fact that when it really came down to it, I was powerless. So that struck a nerve.

So I, forgetting where I was and who I was talking to, launched into my schpiel about how you never really know how you’re gonna react until something happens. You can say you’ll do this or that but when it comes down to the wire, there’s no telling. And I slipped up and let it slip and said, “Well, Dad taught me how to punch as well as you and I still got raped, so that’s not a valid argument.”

Silence.

I quickly tried to fill in the details, that it was a while ago, that I’m fine and I’m dealing with it and everything’s okay, but the damage was done. My mother’s face... She was heartbroken. My dad too. My brother and his girlfriend had no idea what to do. I had no idea what to do. So I tried to steer us toward another topic and eventually with like 10 minutes of coaxing got everyone to join me in discussing the most recent Aladdin movie. But obviously what was done was done.

We were supposed to go shopping around and look at the town after that, but we just went back to the hotel. My mom’s been crying, my dad’s silent. Luckily I’m in a different room (it’s me and my brother’s GF in one room, my parents and brother in the other). When I asked what time I needed to get up and ready for hiking tomorrow, my mom said to just not worry about it, she thinks we should all “sleep in.”

I know it wasn’t wrong to tell them. It was just such bad timing and I wish I’d held my tongue because now I may have just ruined our whole vacation. This is the one time a year we’re all together. I think I may go over there to their room and try to talk about it more, but I don’t want to make them more upset. So I’m stuck, I guess.

Sorry this one isn’t really funny. Just needed to vent, I guess.

TL;DR: Accidentally told my family I’d been raped and ruined our family vacation.

Edit because I didn’t think this would get so much attention: Just wanted to thank you all for your kind words. It means a lot. I was gonna go through and reply to everyone individually, but I worried that might come off as insincere since it would be mostly the same words over and over again, but I am reading all of your comments and the support really does mean a lot to me. I haven’t talked about it a lot, but to be met with such understanding is a huge deal for me. So thank you.

And not that I owe anyone this or the details of my assault, but yes, it was rape. I was repeatedly saying “no” and “stop”. I was crying when I stumbled out. And I was covered in blood from forced penetration and because when it happened, I was a virgin. The reason I didn’t know if it was rape was because, funnily enough, I made excuses for him. He was a Russian exchange student so I just told myself he didn’t know what “no” and “stop” meant, despite the fact that we’d had a perfectly coherent conversation beforehand and his English was very good (not to mention, no and stop are very basic words). I actually often told it as a “funny party story” about this “crazy situation” I’d been in where this weird Russian guy didn’t know the English word for “no.” 70% of the time, I was the only one laughing. I didn’t remember the crying, I thought I just walked out casually, but my roommate, who had been searching for me when we’d disappeared, recently told me I was bawling my eyes out and shaking. I remember the blood and the pain but idk. Never thought rape was something that would ever happen to me because I always thought I would fight back so since I didn’t fight back, it couldn’t have been rape, even though now I know it obviously was. I was just trying to come up with every excuse why such a horrible thing didn’t happen to me, even though it did. Cognitive dissonance, man.

Also, my brother wasn’t deliberately trying to be an asshole. He does know better, he was more bringing it up as a way to get me to debate him. I think all of us know it’s not that simple, and they both felt bad and it definitely wasn’t an intentional dig.

When I was 16 I had two pet scorpions: Pinchy and Raging Bull Jr.  
  
I loved these little guys. I know a lot of people can be squeamish, but I found them so god damn  interesting. They stand in such an aggressive pose for hours, like a statue, then strike at their prey like lightning! They glow under black light! And they drink through their stomachs!

It's important to note that I live in Australia and it was summer, so it's often 35 C and up.  
  
Anyway, I get home after a fun weekend on a Sunday afternoon, say hi to my fam and go to check on my bois in my room.

I go out to my Dad and ask where they are.  
  
He tells me they're outside enjoying the sun.

On a 35 C degree day.  
  
In a glass box.  
  
Needless to say, they were dead and I was distraught. I asked my Dad wtf he was thinking and he genuinely told me that he thought that because scorpions were desert creatures that they'd love the sun. Even though I explained the whole burrowing thing, and that they were mostly nocturnal.  
  
Anyway, RIP guys. My next lot lived a lot longer - Princess Daisy and Raging Bull III. Dad was banned to go near them.

WaterTempleSurvivor,c8kmlp,"Ok so let's all go back to when I was 16. A friend (lets call him Jon) had asked me to attend the wedding of his mother who was getting remarried. I didn't particularly care about his mother, but I did however care about his absolutely drop dead gorgeous cousin (lets call her Sansa). Well, rumor had it that she was going to be at the wedding and rumor had it also that she might even like me (I made that rumor up). So, we head down to a town on the beach where the wedding will take place about a day early. Everyone is staying at this swanky ass hotel on the water with a cool pier going out into the gulf. I foresaw romantic nights under the stars on the end of the pier passionately kissing Sansa as we held each other through the night. Unfortunately my foresight was about as useless as a blind person using glasses to read. 

So all us younger folk all end up hanging out, Jon, Sansa, her friend (lets call her Jeyne), some other cousin (lets just call him Brandon) and I, walking and talking down the pier. Well one topic led to the next and there we are in the middle of a hot and steamy game of truth or dare. I was reeling to have a go at getting dared to kiss Sansa so I dared Jon to kiss Jeyne. They kissed and it was awkward and clumsy seeing as how they weren't really attracted to on another. So I'm up next and I'm thinking I just set myself up perfectly. Now my great friend Jon will dare me to kiss Sansa and it's game on from there I'll be running the bases like Babe Ruth. Nope. Not at all. Lo and behold Jon isn't such a good friend after all, he dares me to jump off the goddamn pier! The girls are giggling and Jon and fucking Brandon are fist pumping chanting ""DO IT!"" as I struggle with this betrayal. I looked to Sansa who surely wouldn't want me to jump off the pier into the murky water for comfort. To my dismay, she started chanting along with the rest of them. 

So I figure I'll have to jump at this point if I'm wanting to move from first base with Sansa. I look over the edge and it's about 15 feet (roughly 5 meters) or so down to the water. The water is grayish brown and I haven't the slightest clue as to how deep it was, but hey I'm 16 and there's a super hot girl waiting for me to do something super cool. So I stand on the edge and take a second to ponder the style of jump I will preform. I think about doing a full on head first dive but change my mind and stick to the ole' legs first fingers on the nose dive. Up up I go and the down into the water with a splash. I'm now in the water and I noticed something wasn't quite right but I'm not sure what it is. I look up and my spectators all have a look of horror on their faces. I'm thinking to myself this isn't good but I'm a fucking optimist so I brush it off and start swimming back to shore which is a good long way off. As soon as I kick my legs to swim I notice one of my feet feels a little weird, it's not really responding and kinda just dangly. I roll over in the water and now understand why Jon, Sansa, Brandon  and Jeyne look like they had seen Ghost, the water had turned a very dark blackish red where I had jumped in. Not a good sign but I'm still a fucking optimist at this point and say hey it can't be that bad. So I swim like a thrashing wildebeest in the Nile back to the shore. When I finally arrive I drag myself out of the water and attempt to stand. When I bring my dangle foot up and out of the water blood torrents from the bottom of it like a waterfall. 

At this point I am no longer an optimist and don't feel so good about by current predicament. So all the beach goers are crowding me and someone takes their shirt off and wraps around my foot which only slightly helps with the blood. An ambulance whoo whoo whoos it's way into to the nearest parking lot and the paramedics rush out to me with a stretcher. I get on and they load me up and cart me off to the hospital. On the way I describe what had happened and the paramedic informs me while he is inspecting my foot that the pier has battering piles which are just multiple poles that go out at an angle to support the pier in the water and that a fun little creature called the barnacle with razor sharp shells like to attach themselves to them. I mean this mother fucker went full David Attenborough on me while I'm bleeding out in the back of his whoo whoo van, so I just sit there in agony and listen. Then out of the fucking blue he yanks something out of my foot and I about passed out from the pain! Apparently I had a large barnacle stuck near the end of my gaping foot hole and he was just distracting me so I wouldn't be aware of his sneaky ass paramedic shenanigans. 

Well, I get to the emergency room and they start fixing me up. I guess I did a real number on myself seeing as how I had to get 96 stitches and severed a couple of my nerves too. Well Jon's whole family came one by one to see me at the hospital and wished me well. Then finally Sansa showed up, she looked me dead in the face and said, ""I can't believe you actually jumped!"" Like what the fuck did you think I was going to do. I'm a horny ass 16 year old male, I'd have jumped out the 5th story hotel window if I knew I had a chance to get some ass. So she left me and I sat there in the hospital like a damn fool and missed the wedding. I never saw Sansa again after that.

JamesWoodMess,c8hvvr,"Well my penis wouldn’t go down after 6 hours (no I did not take erectile disfunction drugs, although i did do that 4 years ago) so they had to inject needles in me and remove the blood. The following morning the same thing happened so I went back to ER for a second round.
I think the doctor during the first injections didn’t remove enough blood so that may be why my penis was hard the next day and I had to go back and get more injections done. I will be seeing a specialist next week for my penis as right now it’s even bigger than it was before and won’t stop erecting. Let me know if anyone of you have questions.

My partner (27M) and I (27F) went to the sex shop to find a water-proof vibrator specifically for shower sex. It's not everyone's thing, but it's our go to. At the recommendation of the lady in the shop, we bought this little bullet with a charging port that was supposedly water-resistant.

One night, after the two of us had shower sex, we rented Hereditary to watch with my dad as he was coming over to visit (him and I are both huge horror buffs). I was HEAVILY freaked afterwards and pretty on-edge in the dark for a few days, dang good movie.

Anyhow, I work from 5:30am-1pm, and my partner works a typical 9-5, there's always that overlap of me being home while he's still working in the afternoon. A couple of days after my dad comes over to watch Hereditary, I get home from work and hear this unidentifiable, absolutely horrifying noise coming from the bathroom. Like something heavy and alive thrashing angrily in the tub. My brain immediately conjured every haunted scenario from every fucking horror movie I've ever seen and I was completely frozen. We keep the bathroom door closed while we're away so our dog doesn't get into the trash, and I was literally too horrified to try opening it. Embarrassing, I know, but i was honestly shaking trying to even approach the door, and the dog wouldn't go near it either. Every horror movie in my life has told me to TRUST THE DOG. So, I call my partner at work, let him listen, send him some videos from outside the bathroom since I'm too panicked to open it, and he agrees to come home to investigate. He's a mechanic (and a sweet angel), so he shows up from across town after a 20 minute drive in the middle of a shift wearing his leather welding gloves, ready to take down either a giant opossum or intruder or poltergeist while I'm in the living room trying to hush a full-blown panic attack. He braces himself against the door, takes a deep breath, pushes it open like a fireman. I immediately hear a heavy sigh, and a ""Babe, please come in here"". Still nervous and shaking I cautiously walked in to see that my ""waterproof"" vibrator had suffered an incredibly delayed shortage from the water exposure, turned itself on while we were at work, and was consequently thrashing (and I'm not using that word lightly) around on the porcelain, scuffing up our tub.

To add to my humiliation, I'd been posting videos about it on Instagram, and when I dropped off updating without letting followers know what HORROR was behind the bathroom door, i got a small flood of DMs from people asking what had happened.

MedicineManfromWWII,c80y3n,"Teenager at summer camp. We did lots of outdoorsy activities, and I eventually (perhaps inevitably) got a tick latched onto my arm. For those that don't know, in addition to being icky, ticks can carry a variety of diseases, one of the worst being Lyme disease. I didn't actually know anything other than the name at the time. Like malaria; you've heard of it, you know mosquitoes carry it, but do you actually know a lot about it?

Anyway, after the tick was removed (more detail below), I was told to keep an eye on the site. However, the removal left no real visible marks where the tick had been. 

Worried that I'd lose track of where exactly the spot was, I decided to do the sensible thing and simply draw on my skin. A circle around the spot where the tick had been attached.

However, being summer camp (with no A/C in the south) and participating in lots of outdoor activities, I was sweating a LOT. A single circle could easily be wiped away and lost track of. So I did multiple circles. Concentric circles, so that I could easily determine the spot even if the smaller circles washed away. I was actually quite proud of my cleverness.

Of course, all the pens in the mess hall were either dried out or out of ink, except for one. It probably was rarely used, due to the fact that it was red. It blended into my skin a bit more than black or blue would have, so I made some of the circles pretty thick.

Later, I went in for a checkup and the ""nurse"" seemed very concerned. I didn't know why, I could barely even see the spot where the tick had been. I pinpointed it really well, and it looked fine to me. She went off to check something (in retrospect to probably tell the camp director that I needed to go to the hospital). While I was waiting, I decided it would be a good time to 'freshen up' my marks. As I feared, they had smeared a little bit with the combination of activity and sweat. So she came back in to me drawing concentric circles around my tick bite. This time in black.

She asked me what I was doing, and I explained. She didn't blow up or anything, just confirmed that I had made both the red and black marks on my arm with a pen, looked at it once more, then told me to leave and wash it off. At the time I thought she was being a little bossy. Couldn't she appreciate my clever solution?

Years later I stumbled upon the symptoms for Lyme disease. If you didn't already know, the most obvious sign is a 'bullseye' pattern around the bitten area.


TLDR; I drew a bullseye around my tick bite so I wouldn't lose track of it, making the camp nurse think I had Lyme disease for a few minutes.

BONUS: Tick removal story. So this 'nurse' was really just a parent of one of the campers who volunteered her time at the camp. I had tons of confidence in her at the time, but in retrospect she was pretty suspect. In this case, she used a cigarette to burn the tick to death while it was attached to my arm. Credit where it's due, she didn't actually burn me with it, but having the red-hot end a millimeter away from my arm was still pretty painful. It also turns out that it's the exact wrong thing to do, as the tick is more likely to regurgitate back into your bloodstream when threatened, increasing the likelihood of disease.

EDIT: The proper way to remove a tick: Get tweezers right down on your skin so you can grab as close as possible to the tick’s head. Pull up slow and firm. Clean well with alcohol and/or soap.",tifu,TIFU by accidentally counterfeiting lyme disease symptoms
kinkyparentsthrwawy,c8e6x5,"This actually happened today, but throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Yesterday, my parents left for a week long vacation and asked me if I would come home to dog sit since I have the summer off as a teacher, so I kissed my fiancé goodbye and drove down to Kentucky for the week. 

Now a bit of backstory: my parents are super religious, both were pastor’s kids and met at a small religious college. I nearly got disowned when my fiancé and I moved in together after five years of dating. We literally have “separate bedrooms” in our house so they can pretend like we don’t share a bed to avoid a scandal back home. You get the idea. Pre Marital Sex is a no. Porn is a no. Sex is shrouded in shame in their world. 

Well, when they aren’t home, their dogs sleep in their room and this morning when I went to let them out, I noticed that Rocky, our old Saint Bernard, had had an accident in the night. So I wash the sheets and give Rocky a bath while they’re drying. 

Then I go to make the bed with the fresh sheets, and that, friends is where I fucked up. I lift up the corner of the mattress to tuck the fitted sheet and underneath the mattress is a set of those under the bed bondage straps. ([like these](https://www.amazon.com/Under-Bondage-Straps-Extra-Strength-Restraint/dp/B01MSVMEFO)) I dropped the mattress and walked away. At some point tonight, I’ll have to work up the courage to go finish making the bed so the dogs’ll have somewhere to sleep. 

Like, on one hand, good for my parents, I guess? Like glad they’re living their best life or whatever?  But on the other hand, I wish to God I’d never seen that for all the obvious reasons of its like walking in on my parents without them even being there, but especially because a few years ago, I bought me and my fiancé almost an identical set of restraints that currently reside under our mattress and I don’t think I will ever be able to use them again. 

Because if there’s one thing that’ll ruin your kink, it’s finding out that you share it with your parents.

xplayingdead,c9ngp4,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, I suppose. But I still feel embarrassment when I think about it to this day, so I'll share it with you too.

Okay, so I have a friend called Dizzie. We played this game together for several years called ""ARK: Survival Evolved.""

I ran a massive PvP server at the time, and for the longest time I had this neutral, not quite allies, relationship with Dizzie. After a couple months, we eventually merged tribes, and once he was in my tribe, I invited him to my discord server.

&amp;#x200B;

This is, unbeknownst to me, the beginning of my fuck up. Dizzie says he has a mic, but he uses it at work and he'll bring it home some other time so he can actually talk to us over mic. But he never does. Several more months pass and none of us have heard Dizzie talk. He always ""forgets"" his mic and I always playfully give him grief about it, but I'm not actually annoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, at this point it's been about 3 months since he originally joined my discord, and I'm playing a game of Overwatch with my friends. And I have the volume up LOUD. I'm actually having a hard time hearing my friends and thinking to myself I need to fix it after the current round.

&amp;#x200B;

Well mid-round, I hear the discord noise that notifies you someone has joined the voice channel. And someone goes ""Whoah, it's Dizzie."" and I see Dizzie's voice indicator lighting up but all I hear is this static-y noise, kind of the way a headset sounds when it's not quite plugged in right. I assume that's exactly what's happening, because after-all this is the first time he's brought his mic home and tried to talk to us. Again, I hear the static noise and I say ""Dizzie, you sound like the monster under the bed."" and I immediately hear the discord noise that indicates someone has left the voice channel. Dizzie is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

A few moments of silence passes and this is the conversation that ensues with my friends.

""xplayingdead, what the hell is wrong with you?""

""What do you mean?""

""Why the fuck would you say that?""

""I don't know, it was a joke?""

""There's clearly something wrong with his voice, that was pretty rude?""

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, my Overwatch is still BLARING loud in my ears. And I'm so confused, but I immediately send Dizzie a message and apologize and explain what I thought I was hearing. It turns out Dizzie was in a car accident the year prior and his car rolled and damaged his vocal chords. As a result he has this really raspy, gravelly sounding voice.

I have never felt so guilty and embarrassed in my entire life. He did end up forgiving me and we laugh about it now and it's still kind of a long running joke between us, but damn.

I was a latchkey kid, and also very interested in how electricity worked.   I was watching a This Old House rerun on PBS and they were showing how to drill a perfect hole in a wall.   Well I was building perhaps the 40th fort in my back yard... all the previous ones had fallen down.   The idea was to make a nice round hole in the wood I was using for a ceiling to let light in.   I figured I could put a light bulb in to get light at night...  (Don't ask about what the light bulb was attached too... my understanding of electricity was spotty at best).

&amp;#x200B;

My fort was about 200 feet from my house, and my parents had told me I wasn't allowed to plug in anything in the outdoor power outlets... what more, the electric drill I found in my dads tools only had a 3 foot cord at most.

Back in 2015 I went to Japan with my family. My mom fell in love with all the koi ponds we saw everywhere, especially in temples around Kyoto. So my dad and I secretly agreed to build a pond into her garden when we would go home.


After some research, we spent a few days digging the pond and building it - liner, pump, filter, decorations... My mom *loved* it. Only one thing was missing: fish. One day, they bought a few fish that would be perfect for the pond. A koi carp, a shunbunkin, and a goldfish.


The fishies were super happy in the pond. We fed them and when I was feeding them, I took the food in my hand and brought it underwater, forcing them to come fetch the delicious food between my big fingers. It was adorable.

The carp and goldfish didn't care at all. But the shunbunkin was so playful! As soon as you came near the pond, he would go to the surface and do little jumps to greet you. If you put your hand or your foot in the water (or any other member, *really*) he would come give it kisses and play with it.


We learned about herons and cranes, and my dad built a safety net above the pond to prevent them, as well as a wire fence around it. We also put a big rock on two bricks so the food had someplace to hide in case of danger. Unfortunately, when I was in college, my parents lost a few fish to herons. But the shunbunkin was the smartest and managed to survive. You go Shushu.



Fast forward to this year. I was away at college the whole time. My parents lost a few fish at first, but they managed to elaborate good protections against the basin. Then for years no fish had perished. They survived several winters, the torrid heat of a few *provençal* summers, until this year. My parents once surprised a dog in the pond, so they reinforced the fence and protections.


Then, a few days later... Shushu was gone. He was nowhere to be seen. Our hypothesis is that a neighborhood dog or cat snatched him and ate him. Of course, we can all picture him go greet the foreign silhouette, and play near it. My mom was really sad. She didn't tell me, but I think she cried. Shushu was so awesome and so adorable.

I told him to come over at around 11pm after my mum had left for work and then I would teach him how to do it etc even though my plan all along was to give him oregano to smoke because A. He wouldn’t know the difference. B. I didn’t want to give him mine because it’s expensive (kinda) and C. I thought it would be funny.

Now what I never knew about C was that he has severe allergies towards oregano and for him, even being near it triggers a reaction in him.

So he got to my house about an hour late and now I was extra determined to pull this ‘prank’ on him, we talked for a bit on what your suppose to do and what your suppose to expect etc. and then finally he took his first hit, almost instantly he said he felt really weird and I just laughed saying that you can’t get high that quick, while kinda worrying deep down, hoping it was just placebo.

On about his third hit, he started sort of swelling up and yep, he was going into anaphylactic shock, I freaked out wondering how the fuck oregano could do this too someone, he said, while getting close to being unconscious, that he needed an epipen ASAP and that he had one for emergencies in his backpack, of course my stupid ass couldn’t find his backpack and it took me a minute to realise that my sisters epipen was in the kitchen drawer, so I sprinted for it, I knew to jab it into his leg but I had no clue how so it took me about 30 seconds to do so, once I finally did it, I ran and called 000 (emergency service number for Australia) and then both of our parents. By the time the ambulance got there, he was pretty much fully conscious again but they still took him to the hospital, followed by my dad and I in our van.

When we got there, I had to explain the entire situation to both, our parents and the medical staff, who were and still are extremely furious and now I’m grounded for the next six fucking months (although I guess I deserve it) Although good news is, C is not all that mad at me for almost killing him even though he’s stuck in the hospital for observation until tomorrow afternoon.

So when I was a kid, my family had this specific Fourth of July tradition, every 4th of July we would get up at like 5:00am and go pick blueberries. I HATED doing this as a kid. Who wants to get up that early on summer break and go sweat in the humid southern summers doing what amounts to farm work??

So when I was around 8 or 9 I had enough of this. I said it wasn’t fair that I had to go do this when I dont even like blueberries. And it worked. Never had to go again. But from that day on I had to pretend that I didn’t like blueberries. Any time there were blueberry muffins, blueberry cobbler, blueberries in a fruit salad, I had to abstain. 

I did recently come clean to my parents about this, and they said they knew all along, and laughed. My youngest sister had actually ratted me out a while ago. So they’ve known for a while, but said they’d suspected for years. 

But here’s the fuckup. I went so long without eating blueberries I actually don’t like them now. I opt out of blueberries or blueberry flavored things. I literally gave myself an aversion to them! I played myself!

I pulled a few bowls, opened the dishwasher, sneezed, and promptly put a steak knife halfway through my hand. I immediately panic and start trying to get the knife out but it was serrated and in the process of tearing the shit out of my hand I let out the most bloodcurdling scream I could muster. I dropped about a hundred “fuck you’s” and “you bitch’s” before pulling it out and grabbing some paper towels. While I’m cleaning up the blood someone starts pounding on the door which I ignored because fuck I was bleeding out in my kitchen. Two more people showed up and knocked which I ignored as well. I walk back to the living room to eat my breakfast when I look out the window. There, on my porch, are three police officers ready to take down the front door.

Top_Gorilla17,c9i1c4,"Have you ever woken up and had something immediately happen that set the bar so high for the day that literally *nothing* could top it? That was *my* morning, today. 


Allow me to explain: See, I live with two roommates, my best friend and his girlfriend, in their basement. It's a pretty decent arrangement from my end because my rent is relatively modest, compared to if I got my own place, but you could write a sitcom about us, because we inhabit totally opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to how we think and operate. That is to say, I'm more of a bohemian; A brooding creative with what the medical profession refers to as ADHD. My best friend, 'J' was raised an only child, and thus has some minor entitlement issues, while simultaneously being a young Hank Hill-type, *I tell you h'wat*. His girlfriend, 'K', for the most part, fills sort of the straight-laced voice-of-reason role, and is, for better or worse, stuck in the middle of our shenanigans.


Now, since J is something of a traditionalist, he views free time as an opportunity to do work on the house and shit. He also generally feels entitled to my assistance, saying passive aggressive things like “Don’t be afraid to do ‘x’,” or “guess what you get to do, tomorrow?” Consequently, I am often conscripted to his cause. I don't mind for the most part, but it's always more dramatic than it needs to be, because he has a tendency to get frustrated if things don't go perfectly, even when it's his own damn fault. If he screws something up, and catches it later, he gives me crap for not noticing and telling him sooner. This comes back to my ADHD, which manifests itself by way of me becoming laser-focused on one thing and one thing only, to the detriment of everything else. If I had a nickel for every time he's told me ""you've got to start paying attention to your surroundings, bro,"" I'd be a very wealthy man, indeed.


That brings me to what I'm writing about today.


Every year, J and K host a little Fourth of July soiree in the backyard. It's a pretty good time. J grills these bomb-ass burgers and brats, maybe some chicken, there's all kinds of beer and soft drinks. It's pretty sweet, but I always have to help with the preparations, which is *lame*. This year, J got it into his head that we needed to wire up some speakers in the back yard so we could bump some music during the party. Cool idea, but we did this during the early part of the week when the air was thick with Iowan humidity, which sucked my giant swampy balls. Naturally, when things didn't go as smoothly as possible, J gave me the ol' ""you gotta pay attention to your surroundings, bro"" speech again. That said, after more effort than I personally felt it was worth, we did the thing, and we could now bump tunes using bluetooth in the backyard like bosses.


And you know what? It was a hit. People loved it, and the party went well, aside from the cops stopping us from launching some fireworks. We had some good food, good beer, just a good time all around. Everyone left happy, and I went to bed a bit earlier than J and K because they had the good sense to get today off too, whereas I had not thought about it.


So, when I wake up in the morning, my routine is always the same; I get up, put on some work clothes (I typically shower the night before to avoid having to compete with the roommates for bathroom time), and step out back for a quick smoke before I head to the office. Most of the time it's uneventful, but today was a bit different.


I was still kind of waking up, so I didn't immediately notice it, but once I lit up my cigarette, I started hearing this... *Slurping sound*... I wasn't sure what the hell it was, but it started getting more and more intense, and louder and louder. Then came the moans, and it hit me like a truck;


*One or both of my roommates were watching porno on his phone, and had forgotten to disconnect it from bluetooth!*


So the backyard just sounds like an orgy, which is loud enough for anyone on the block to hear, and I start laughing, but I feel really awkward about it so I try to get into the garage to turn off the speakers, but it's locked and I don't have the key, so I have no choice but to text homeboy;


""**Yo! Bluetooth! BLUETOOTH!**""


A few moments later, I hear a beep from the phone disconnecting, and then I send a second text.


""**Yo, you gotta be more aware of your surroundings, bruh!**""

Theriii,c9q9ya,"So, to start off, my grandmother is an extremely Christian lady. She constantly puts her opinions on others, openly discourages and does not condone homosexuality (little does she know, the same lips I give her smooches with are the same ones I went down on my girlfriends with), and is extremely judgmental of anything non-Christian. 

A couple of weeks ago I was helping her unpack her stuff (she had moved into a nearby senior citizen community so she could be closer to me and my mom), when we decided to start jamming out to older music. She suddenly stops and turns to me, obviously thinking about something. 

I ask her what, and she tells me that she can’t remember a singer’s name. I ask her what she remembers, and she replies that she only remembers his first name: Johnny. For absolutely no reason at all, I blurt: 

“JOHNNY SINS!” 

The moment I said it, the moment I knew I fricked up. I felt my smile quickly drain off of my face as I watched her pick up her IPad to search up Johnny Sins. She is instantly bombarded with porno videos starring the one and only, Johnny Sins. 

I could literally feel my face burning red as she exited the search and began yelling at me, asking why I knew of this ‘unholy, deviant man’. She told my mother (who thankfully wasn’t mad, but laughed at me), and sent me about 6 bible verses about lust, desire, and getting rid of sin. Sorry, Mimi.

murkar,c80jof,"Since there's been a lot of weird sex stuff here lately, figured I'd share something real but also terrifying.

Obligatory this happened about 3 years ago (and I'm still not over it).

For some context - it was about 1am...I lived in an apartment building which was kinda sketchy, and in a sketchy neighborhood. It's January so it's -30 outside, and not really anything nearby to walk to. Neighbors were partying super late, went outside to knock on their door to tell them to shut up. Nobody answers, hallway smells like dope, I assumed they're all stoned and nobody's coming to the door. I have a meeting at 8am, which means leaving at 6am in traffic so being woken up in the middle of the night is getting on my nerves and giving me a killer migraine. Cool. My head hurts and I'm tired.

Decide to go down to the parking garage (which is in the basement) and get some pain killers and a sleeping pill to knock me out so I don't feel like death in the morning. Admittedly mistake #1 was forgetting them in my car. Mistake #2: I left my phone and wallet inside, lock the door on my way out. I'm just running down to the car, right? What do I need my phone for.

So half-asleep me gets in the elevator and goes down to the parking garage to get some migraine meds.

This is where the real fuck-up happens. I'm standing in the elevator playing with my keys. Door opens, I go to get out and - oops - drop them on the floor.

You ever worry ""hey, there's that slot on the floor where the elevator door retracts - better grip my keys for dear life""?

Well I sure hadn't. I do now. I watch in horror as my keys fall straight down into that space and right down into the elevator shaft. Yes, this is a thing that can happen - and you aint getting your keys back. They're fucking gone.

So it's 1am, my keys are now gone. I'm locked out of my apartment, no phone, no wallet, no coat. I can't get into the car either. And again, it's fucking January - so it's -30c out. I can't walk anywhere. I can't call anyone. RIP me. At this point it starts to sink in what's happened and I realize I'm turbo-screwed. 

Go up to the main lobby...there's one of those wall-phones for calling units. I dial security and then the main office, neither answer. Shit. Keep trying. No answer. Finally they pick up - I explain the situation and the security guy (asshole) says ""Well, nothing I can do - I guess you'll have to figure it out."" Then hangs up on me (??!?!?). Wow thanks bud. Can't even borrow a phone to call someone to come pick me up.

I ended up staying on the bench in the main lobby until morning. Luckily the main office opened early and had a spare key for my unit. I ran in, got dressed and barely made it to the most exhausted meeting of my life.

youngdumbdrunk,c8a7nt,"Disclaimer: in light of the recent meta post about fake TIFUs, I will swear on my life and my mother’s life that this really happened. And it’s not NSFW, so there’s that too. This is a real, honest-to-goodness TIFU. Throwaway account because privacy. \*Details have been altered, also for privacy.

This happened two-ish years ago. It all started with being a young college freshman and getting a fake ID. Long story, bear with me. TLDR at the bottom, as always.

I go to a small university in a big city and I major in \*communications (this will be important later.) I was helping a friend of mine organize an opening for an art gallery/garage rock show, and my job ended up being tracking down the alcohol for the refreshments table. This was simple enough, considering I lived next door to a wine and liquor store that never even asked to see my ID, so buying large bottles of wine was a breeze even though I was only 18 (good ol’ US of A, if this had been anywhere else this TIFU would not have happened.) The hard part was getting 50+ beers, since the liquor store didn’t sell beer. I had a budget that I had to stick to, so I only looked at cheap, college beer (PBR, Coors, natty light.) 6-packs are still like $10, but a 24-pack is $13 at Target. Except using a fake ID at Target is one of the dumbest things you could do. So I drive from corner store to corner store for about three hours the day of the opening looking for cheap beer in bulk. Then I saw that my shitmobile car had started running out of gas. 

This is where the real TIFU begins. I pull into a gas station, and it’s the kind where you have to pay inside. I park my car at a pump, go inside, and the first thing I see are 3 glorious 24-packs of PBR for $11 each. Perfect! I grab those and go buy gas. As the guy is scanning my beers he asks for my ID. No problem, confidence is key. I reached for my ID but then he began apologizing for asking. “I’m sorry, you look older but we had an undercover cop fine us last week.” and then he and his assistant started rambling about how much the fine was and how they can’t lose their business. Mind you, I’m a 5’0” girl in a little black dress, I look like I’m 15 and I raided my mom’s closet. I hand them my ID and say it’s alright I understand. Then a very large man walks in, dressed in full local baseball team gear. He doesn’t look threatening so I pay him no mind. As he walks in, the cashier looks at my ID and says “Oh, you’re from \*Georgia! No wonder you’re such a nice young lady, everyone is so nice down there.” I’m not from Georgia and we were in a state at least 1,000 miles away from Georgia. Anyway, I pay and start to walk out. Then I hear the large baseball fan ask if anyone around had jumper cables, that his car died and he’s trying to go home. I don’t know what came over me. I usually mind my own business. But I drove a shitmobile so I always had jumper cables. “Hey I can help, I have cables” I said. The guy thanked me 10 times and asked if I could give him a lift to his car, that it was a few blocks away. Again, I would never let a strange man into my car, especially if he’s 4 times my size. But I forgot everything I learned about stranger danger and said yes, I could give him a lift. I got in my car, looked over to the passenger seat, and my heart dropped to my ankles.

The man lifted his shirt and showed me a gun, handcuffs, and a badge. I’m FUCKED, I thought, a cop just saw me commit fucking fraud. Goodbye college. Then he started talking. He said “Sorry if I intimidate you, I’m \*Sargeant Michael Hudson with the PD of the city, I won’t hurt you.” ok, at least I won’t get raped, but I’m still going to fucking prison. A plainclothes COP was in my car, and I had 72 illegally purchased beers, 5 bottles of wine, and an OUNCE of the devil’s lettuce in my backseat (weed was decriminalized but not legal in this state, but I was 18 so I was too young to have it anyway.) I thought if I can get this man to his car with minimum information being shared between us I’d be in the clear. And then he started making small talk.

“So, you’re from Georgia, how come you don’t have an accent?” 

Oh man. Oooooh fuck. Okay. Time to put your improv troupe experience to the test. “I’m from \*Maine, but my parents split and I moved to Georgia with my dad when I was 16.” I’m not from Maine and and my parents are very much still together, and I’ve never even been to Georgia. I don’t know where I came up with that lie. 

“But your car has \*Delaware plates. How come…”

“Oh it’s my roommate’s car, she lent it to me for the day.” Again, I don’t know where this came from. My roommates are both from \*Oregon. 

“That’s nice, so what brings you to The City?”

“College.” fuck. He knows I’m a young’un. 

“Oh so you’re graduating soon huh? What’s your major?” I’m in the clear.

“Yeah, I’m a senior in \*Computer Science.” I was a freshman in Communications, why the fuck did I say that. I don’t know jack shit about computer science. What if he asks me questions? My knuckles turn white on the steering wheel and I feel like I’ve been in the car with this guy for three hours. 

“That’s smart, a lot of career opportunities for computer science these days. My car is up here on the left.” 

Fantastic. I made it without getting arrested. I jump start his car, he offers me a $20 but I decline because I just want him to leave, which he does, thanking me profusely. I sit there double-parked on the corner hyperventilating, trying to process what just happened, contemplating my life and who I am. I blocked out the memory for a long time after that but then I allowed myself to remember, mostly because I told my parents and they laughed. I still consider this to be the closest I’ve ever gotten to going to prison. It still gives me nightmares. I never used my fake ID again.

*Warning, some may find this story a little distressing*

TLDR at the bottom. 

I was home alone, minding my own business, when suddenly I started to hear lots of commotion right outside my front door. I could hear people crying, panic and the like. Alarm bells started ringing in my head. I checked out the window and saw lots of people in my front garden, and blood on the pathway leading to my front door. I immediately opened the door to see what the hell was going on... I was horrified to see that unfortunately a poor little dog had been hit on the road outside my house and had landed effectively right on my doorstep... I saw a woman crying and people consoling her. When I say crying, I mean she was absolutely distraught. She was shaking, hyperventilating... I assumed she was the owner, so I went to offer my sympathy. I was a bit overcome with emotion myself at this point, so I wasn't really thinking straight. I told her how sorry I was, asked her if she needed anything etc. But then, in my emotional state, my thoughts turned to the driver who was apparently nowhere to be seen! I started saying about what sort of disgusting person would do this, how horrible of them, how evil they must be to not even stop, etc. I really went in hard roasting this driver who didn't even have the common decency to stop. That's when my neighbour told me that the woman I was talking to actually was the driver. The owners live at the other end of the street and were being notified as we spoke... Needless to say, I was mortified, and the poor woman looked even more distressed. I apologised profusely, trying to explain that I didn't know and saying how much of an idiot I was, but the damage had already been done.

A hard lesson was learned that day. Don't assume, and don't talk shit behind people's backs.

PopeAdrian37th,c9uu7a,"This happened a little while back when my dog was younger. After having out first child my wife and I were being a little cautious and used condoms until her birth control was fully in her system. One of my habits after finishing was to tie of the condom to get the peace of mind that the thing did its job and didn't have any holes. After tying it off I tossed in the bathroom trash and jumped in the shower. Shortly after my dog came in the bathroom to be around me and lay on the tile. Or so I thought.

During my wife's pregnancy and shortly after my dog was obsessed with chewing my my wife's underwear. Apparently the flavor he crazed translated to the outsides of condoms too because this dude found a snack.

Fast forward to the next day we took him to the dog park to get him some exercise. First thing he does is mark his spots then I see him doing his awkward circle indicating he's about to drop his deuce. As I start waking over to him, he does a squatted hobble and tries walking a dingle off - but that's no ordinary dingle. As I get up to him I can see that appears to be the tip and shaft of a condom. The base ring got stuck on the inside! To make things worse, while the color of the condom was now an off brown, I could clearly see my pack of swimmers still tied up in the tip.

Luckily we had the diaper bag with us so I grabbed a wipe a went back to help my dog. And of course some other people came over to try to see if he needed help right as I'm relieving my dog and pulling out the dirty rubber. ""Nope I think we got it, but thank you"".

I thought I was home alone as my mum said the morning before I left she had a meeting at 3:45. I thought meant she would not be home because most of her meetings happen in London somewhere. 

So when I arrived home I jumped in through my window because its easier than going around my house, and my room is on the bottom floor. I took of my school trousers so u was in my boxers and changed my shirt so I could get down to the business.

 So I hopped into bed being as loud as I wanted and started watching porn. And here’s where it goes to shi* towards the end my earphone unplugged a bit so it was playing out loud and I thought fuck it, I’m gonna watch porn out loud cuz I’m a man. Wrong. Move.

So I waltz in to the living room, with my still kinda erect penis leading the way, only to be met with a room of businessy looking people chatting.

I started freaking out, realized I need to get them out, started the car, rolled down all the windows and started driving.

There was a woman on the sidewalk who must have seen a cloud of flies flowing out of my car as I drove off.

I parked at a grocery store parking lot and opened all the doors and stood there watching these flies leave wondering WHAT THE FUCK was going on.

The watermelon. It hit me.

I always have trash bags in my car (we do a lot of camping).

I opened the cooler just a hint to confirm the source of this terror. More bugs came out. I closed it, put it in a trash bags which I tied shut.

I put the entire thing in another trash bag just for kicks, exhaled, and drive home to get rid of it.

I'm going to have nightmares about this. I've never been in a cloud of flies like this and I'm embarrassed and disgusted and disappointed. I'm glad I didn't open the cooler all the way and look in because my guess about what was festering and maggotting in there probably isn't as bad ass what was actually happening in there.

So. Now I gotta clean everything in there, but that cooler will never be seen again.

Don't forget about the watermelon, folks. It's summer.

Fucking EEEW!

TLDR; I didn't realize I had watermelon festering in my car and was met by an army of hundreds of flies when I got in",tifu,TIFU by not realizing I left watermelon rotting in my car

Sooo for about two weeks, I've only been sleeping like 5 hours a night. I'm usually a monster if I don't get 8, but I've been great! I chalked it up to recent diet changes and getting back into a hobby I love, but I did find it weird how reduced my DESIRE to sleep was. I take melatonin every night, and have been all week, going as far as to take 3 (the most I've ever taken) about a week ago, but even so I'd stay up late reading, writing, and watching Netflix with little to no desire to sleep, and then wake up promptly at 7:30 am. Without fail.

Today I was cleaning my room and found an unopened bottle of melatonin. Weird. I was pretty sure I had only purchased one. I go look at the bottle I had been using after light's out.

Extra strength 5,000 mcg B-12 Energy Supplements.

The same brand. The same size. The pills were dissolvable strawberry tablets, just like my favorite melatonin brand.

I guess I'll sleep tonight.

Billman-Warren,c8ow3u,"This actually happened this morning.

At my work, I often order a lot of things for people from amazon using my prime account, which I have set up as the business account. 

One time, the studio manager assumed I had ordered something I didn’t, because on his credit card statement the charge ends in AMZN.COM/BILLWA . Bill Warren is my name. So confused, and thinking “well, obviously I must have ordered it” I tried to track it down in my orders and couldn’t find it. He found it in his orders, and we both wrote it off as weird.

Cue literally Today, when our financial rep sends me a huge list of amazon charges (each ending in BILLWA) saying she didn’t have Reciepts for any of them, totaling around $600. I had bought maybe $35 on her card, and she already had that Reciept (becuase im meticulous and do everything to be transparent, so I get permission and send all paperwork when I order everything. 

Again, I think “we’ll, obviously I must have, but I have no record or memory of any of those charges? How the hell is this happening?!”

Derpderpdrpepper,c7x675,"Ok, so this story dates back to when I was 18, so about 7 years ago. I've always wanted to post something here, but never had any good stories to tell... until last night when I remembered this horrible, horrible forgotten memory.

So yeah, for a bit of setting I used to work at a summer camp that was located in the middle of nowhere. Kids would come for 2 weeks at a time, we would often do camping and other outdoors-y activities including but not limited to archery, rockclimbing, and horseback riding!

Now, if any of you ever had horses you know that anything can spook them. Traffic tends to be a big one but I've seen some go wild because of their shadow. It can be quite funny to witness as long as you aren't riding one at the time.

Everyday the kids would have kind of a free time. Usually they would be in their groups doing activities together, but for 1h 30 everyday they were free to mingle, go to the beach, or just chill. There would be at least one employee in every hotspot, with a few just patrolling to see what's what.

This is where this story begins. I was on patrol duty that day and I was near where we keep the horses. Of course one of them goes nuts and starts jumping, but on a very specific spot. Imagine a cat attacking a mouse, it kinda looked like that.

I walk up to the horse to sooth her a bit, and then I see what the fuss was about. The horse got spooked by a bunny rabbit and then proceeded to stomp it to death!!!

I'm thinking omg I gotta get it out of here before any of the kids see, but then I notice it is still alive... somehow. It's lower body is completely crushed with bones sticking out, the poor thing is in deep suffering. Nothing should have a slow painful death, and I wasn't gonna let this cute rabbit leave the world like this.

So I go to the stable and grab the shovel for manure. When I come back I give the animal a few pets, hope it finds peace, and I get to work.

Whack! First blow didn't do the trick, it starts having spasms all through its body

Whack 2! Head caves in a bit, but its still moving. At this point I'm starting to feel sick and just want to get it over with. Who knew pity killing an animal could be so stressful.

Whack 3! Seems to have done the trick but I'm not thinking straight, I hit it 2 more times. It's head is basicaly a crushed puddle kinda thing at this point. At least I know I didn't halfass it and let the poor thing in even more pain.

Then I hear a gasp and a cry behind. For real turning around felt like an eternity. I got caught doing something very, very wrong even if I still think it was the right thing to do.

Turns out, 6 kids had witnessed the entire time. They weren't in my group thank god but I still lost a lot of respect from everybody that day. For the remaining week it was all the kids talked about and the cringe felt as thick as humid air. Of course, I was not hired at that summer camp again...

And yes, I do feel horrible about the entire thing.

So I'm a camp counselor.  At my camp, we have this big carnival near the end of the session where the campers can win tickets to a raffle that happens later in the evening.

The carnival ends and my bunk gathers all their tickets together at our table while we listen up to hear what's being raffled off (things like extra curfew and free candy). It's nearing the end of the raffle and my bunk hasn't won anything yet. All the girls are looking super bummed. I'm noticing that a lot of prizes are going unclaimed. To try to be the 'cool counselor' I tell them that for the next prize that seems like it's gonna go unclaimed, lets all stand up and cheer like we won it because they aren't really checking tickets anyway.

Sure enough, the second to last prize looks like its gonna go unclaimed so I signal to my girls and we execute the plan perfectly. Everyone cheers and they all get extra candy following dinner the next night. They are psyched.

A little backstory: My wife and I are looking to sell our home because we are having a new one built.  We figured Zillow would be a good option because they let you stay in your current home until your new one is done being built. 

After speaking with the rep at Zillow, he said they’ll need me to text him photos of the house so they can get a better offer sent out.  Seems simple enough right?  Nope.

The next day I woke up and my stomach was not happy.. so I got up, took care of some business, and thought, “Let’s take some photos!”  Only problem is, I sleep in my birthday suit, and I didn’t get dressed before dropping the “kids” off that morning.  And of course, I was rushed because I needed to leave for work.

So I start my journey of taking photos of everything, guest bedroom, offices, master bedroom, stairway... you know, the normal things a house has. When I got to the guest bathroom I very carefully angled the phone so you couldn’t see me in the reflection, as I was still in my birthday suit.   I get to the master bathroom, angle my phone, snap the photo; and before I had another thought.. WHOOSH, I sent the photos to the Zillow guy. 

About a half hour later I got a message that says “Received. Thanks..”  so I think to myself, that’s weird. So I go and look at the photos I sent, just to make sure I didn’t send blurry ones.

waterparkgal123,c8xpf1,"This happened just earlier this week.

I had family in town so we all decided to go to a nearby lagoon with an obstacle course on the water, the one where you slip and slide trying to make your way through everything. Note to self - it’s a lot harder than it looks.

I was on my period so naturally I decided to plug up the ol’ vagina with a trusty tampon. After slipping and sliding on my ass a bunch, and floating in the water whilst accepting my lack of athleticism, I went to the bathroom to change my tampon. I look down. No string. No big deal, it probably got pressed up by the buttocks. Still can’t find the string. Shamefully, I opened up the camera app on my phone to locate the string and pull this sucker out, only to see that there was in fact no string.

After standing in the bathroom for an embarrassingly long amount of time, not knowing in the slightest what to do, I decided that my tampon fell out. I was landing crotch first in the water, anything can happen, right? 

After putting in another tampon (probably not the best move) I finished my day out in the water park. After freaking out about the whole situation with my mom (she didn’t go with us and yes, i’m a teenager) we decided to book an appointment at the urgent care for the next morning, just in case.

Flash forward to the next morning, I’m feeling fine and am feeling pretty confident that there is no tampon in me. I get called in, and have to embarrassingly explain why I’m there at 8 o’ clock in the morning, and sit on the table with my legs in the stirrups. Doctor checks with her finger, says she can see nothing. I think ‘alright, next five mins I’m gonna be out of here.’ While using the very friendly-looking speculum, the doctor exclaims, ‘There’s a tampon in here.’ 

I think, ‘OK, good thing we went. Now I’m no longer about to get TSS. My life is saved.’

Doctor goes, “There’s two!”

“Two?”

The doctor then proceeds to crank open the speculum which hurt like HELL. I’m screaming out in pain while constantly asking “Is it out? Is it out?” while she fishes around to grab the other one.

Now I’m even more embarrassed about being there. I already have this weird story of going on an obstacle course in the water, and now I show up with two tampons shoved in my vagina. Doctor remarks that she’s never see anyone with two tampons stuck before. Cue me feeling even more embarrassed. I now can’t use tampons for the rest of my period, which means no pool days and no beach days for 4th of July.

So. I ended up forgetting about a tampon, AND managed to get a second one shoved up there by slipping and sliding too much at an obstacle course on the water. 

TL;DR: Went to urgent care because I didn’t know if a tampon fell out or not while on an obstacle course in water. While in urgent care doctor pulled out 2 tampons.

Chiebbs,c9wc14,"So as the title says, this occurred on the 4th, two days before posting this.

Anyway, I met a girl online, on the r4r subreddit about a week and a half ago. We are both from the same state and the same city which I think we both believed to be crazy odds considering it’s not a big city. We talked for a while over Discord and things were going well enough that she actually invited me to a meet up at a local Starbucks on the 4th, as she works and has a life (unlike me) and couldn’t really do any other day.

The day of reckoning arrives.
So we have plans to meet at 1:00pm and I, wanting to arrive on time, decide to shower and get ready around 10:00am. I get into my birthday suit and start up the shower, climb in and begin to lather on the shampoo. I’m able to get through washing my hair and my face, but as I reach back to grab my soap, gravity and aerodynamics have a different idea, along with a glob of shampoo that must have fallen onto the baths floor.

I’m a rather large man at 6’0 feet/1.8 meters, 250 lbs/113 kg. And boy did I feel every inch/lbs. Now I’m not sure in what order my body hit what parts of the tub, but the first one I felt was my head, my tub has one of those slants that make it easier to rest back against if you use the bath portion, and my head hit that. The second thing I felt was a sharp pain in my right side, in the area commonly referred to as “love handles”. I look down and notice a big piece of porcelain sticking into my side, it turns out to be part of my soap holder bolted into the side of the shower, and like an idiot I think to just pull it out and chuck it to the side. The third thing I felt was after trying to stand up for the first time, when like a further dumb idiot, I try to grab the remaining attached pieces of the soap holder for support and just end up cutting my hand open on the sharp edges. At this point, I’ve just kinda given up and decided to finish my shower, I’d never not finish a shower before and I wasn’t gonna start now, so I finish conditioning and soaping the rest of my body before trying for round two of getting out of the tub, this would have been easier if there was anything stable to grab onto from ground level, but I don’t have a grab bar and the edges around the rim of my tub are made of metal and kinda sharp, so I didn’t want to grab that. But I somehow manage to get up and get myself out of the shower, dry off and finish with the regular routine of brushing my hair and teeth and so on. Eventually the brilliant idea of calling someone to come look after me crossed my mind and so I called my Mom and she came quick as a flash and helped me bandage and clean up. For the most part I felt fine, other than shaky legs and a little dull soreness coming from my head.

I knew I might have a concussion and so I forced myself to stay awake for several hours before the need to sleep came over me. I woke up early the next morning in the worst pain I had ever been in, my head throbbed and my side felt pretty bad, hand was okay. But my head was by far the worst. Now, to continue with the theme of good ideas I’d been having the last 24 hours, I decided to drive myself down to the E.R and get checked out. Sure enough, I have a concussion, big surprise there, and my side needed cleaning and stitching, my hand was okay, they just told me to keep it clean and bandaged. And then they just sent me on my way, the man with the concussion.

Anyway, to bring this story to a close, I had to call off the date obviously, which I felt really bad about and I hope she forgives me and gives me another chance.

SunstyIe,c8bigz,"This ""TIFU"" wasn't today, but was about 15 years ago. TLDR at the end

At the time of this fuck up, I had just finished off a successful year at college and was starting a summer job to help pay for bills and tuition. Not knowing where to find work, a friend told me to apply for a temp job at a company called The Associates. It would be an indoor office thing, working at a computer all day, which was nice since I was living in Dallas Texas, which is hellish during the summer if you work outdoors.

I was fairly tech savvy, but knew nothing about office jobs- I had mowed lawns and done chores when I was too young for an actual job, and then I changed oil in cars before leaving for college. An office job would be quite the change of pace.

The Associates was getting bought out by Citigroup. The buyout happened in 2000 but it took many many years for everything to get sorted and rolled through in phases. My job that summer was to help with one part of that transition. Basically, we need to document the transfer all of the vehicle titles from The Associates to Citigroup and digitize them. The Associates pretty much had everything on paper, whereas Citigroup wanted everything digital. This was a $31 billion dollar acquisition, so there were a LOT of car titles, but this was just one small cog in a massive machine of this acquisition. I was the only temp there- everyone else in the office (5 or so workers + 1 manager) had been there for many years under Citigroup, and were still there 4 years after the buyout helping with office work and moving the car titles over.

So day 1 I was given a big stack of physical car/vehicle titles which I needed to put into the DOS-based system for Citigroup. All of the titles mostly had the same information in them. I might get a stack of 50+ titles that had the same starting owner/division/location, and would go to a different Citigroup division. It being DOS-based meant that there were no simple copy-and-paste functions or shortcuts to make the tedium less painful. I was literally going to be typing the same stuff over and over and over all day long, with the only thing changing on each page being the VIN number. Suddenly the thought of working outside in the hot sun and at least getting to socialize and get some exercise seemed much more appealing. How in the world could I survive a whole summer of doing that, let alone these 5 people that had been doing this for years?

After the first day or two of work I had a general feel for how the title system worked and decided I would see if I could find any tricks to make things more efficient. Copying wasn't possible, pasting wasn't possible. But I was determined: there had to be something.

After adding in a title and saving it, I wondered what would happen if I had made a mistake. Surely I could update that file, right? I typed in the VIN number as a search and it found the file, which I could update. Now, what if I changed the VIN # and hit save? Would that erase the first one, or would it create a new file with the new VIN? I gave it a test, and it saved as a new file! With that one change I could complete 8 hours of work in about 30 minutes.

Knowing that if I shared that information they'd just find additional tedious work for me to do for the summer, I kept the info to myself. I made sure to spread out the work a bit during the day so they wouldn't get wise when they checked on my progress, and after they confirmed several times a day that I was on track they stopped paying attention to me. I clearly got my work done and was giving them zero errors, so I was free to be ignored.

Sitting deep in the maze of tall cubicles, no one could see or hear what I was doing all day, so I slept and read books. I developed a knack for sitting up while sleeping which was very useful. I also would take long lunches, long walks, and basically just anything to fill the day. It was a pretty relaxing (if not boring) summer.

My fuckup happened on the last day of work. Before quitting I decided to share my more efficient way of doing things with my manager, since I figured they had paid me all summer to pretty much just hang out. Maybe I should throw them a bone. My manager's mind was blown with how much better and more efficient my trick was- they could complete the work at warp speed now. He thanked me, and I left the building satisfied with my summer of goofing around and sleeping at my desk.

A few weeks later my friend that referred me to that job told me that everyone in the department was let go, save one person. In hindsight I should have shared my secret with my coworkers, not with the manager =(. On the upside this was back in the early 2000's when jobs were abundant and money rained down from the sky.

TLDR figured out a way to complete 8 hours of work in 30 minutes, which I used to goof off all summer. Told my boss on the last day of work and inadvertently got four people fired.",tifu,"TIFU by teaching my boss a more efficient way to do things, which got several employees let go"

plushusheen,c9dhg6,"Obligatory- this happened 1 year ago.

I met up with a guy I had been talking to for a while on Tinder. I was really nervous because I hadn't been on a date for ages and he was very attractive. After talking in a bar for a while, we were laughing and having a great time and everything was going well.

We decided to go to a club for some dancing and to have a few more drinks. Needless to say, we started to get a bit tipsy and things got hot and heavy really quickly- kissing and grinding all over each other. Since I hadn't gone out on a date with such an attractive guy for quite some time I was kissing him quite aggressively and at one point he pulled away telling me he needs to go the bathroom. When he returned, he was covering his mouth and he told me that as he was suspecting most of his front tooth is broken because he felt it moving in his mouth while we were kissing. As it turns out, I had broken his tooth when kissing him and I accidentally hit his teeth with my own.

Surprisingly, he took it very well and was joking about it the whole time and teasing me about it. We ended the night on really good terms and he actually asked me out on a second date!

.... and countless ones after that. Fast forward to today and he's now my boyfriend and we love each other very much. We still joke about it sometimes and I'm forever grateful that he wasn't turned off by me being such a klutz!

He would come in randomly just to say hi, sometimes buy change from us for his store and vice versa. Always pleasant. “Hey, Geddy! How are you?” So forth and so on.

Fast forward six months. Overhead a conversation with him and another customer. Turns out the guy’s name is “Gary”. I thought “Geddy” was maybe a shortened version of a traditional Indian name. Nope! I was unintentionally mocking the dude’s accent to his face for six months.

deargodkillmenowww,c9ksrc,"This is a really bad TIFU. I’m still in shock over everything that happened.. Using a throwaway because anonymity.

It happened last night during the 4th of July. Me and this girl, we’ll call her “M,” have been really hitting it off and seeing each other for the past couple weeks. She’s a single mother of a 1-year old kid and is all around a beautiful hard-working mother.

Anyways, M and I were at Buffalo Wild Wings with some of her coworkers and we were having a good time. Before coming, I had bought $200 worth of fireworks and around $50 worth of alcohol. I even made an apple pie from scratch because I like cooking and had to use some apples that were about to expire. 

M asked me if I wanted to come back to her place with her friends and party, so I was like “Hell yeah! I have a ton of alcohol and fireworks.” So we go to her place and the night is full of drinking, dancing, music, fireworks, and people. Overall it was a great party.. until the fuck up happened..

So, M is really cautious with men because she’s been treated like dirt by them for most of her life. I’m always trying to be patient and kind to her and show her that I’m willing to put in the work and protect her and her kid. Well, a song came on that I liked and she was dancing and I went over and joined her, put my hands on her waist, but then she got... skittish? Scared? Idk what the word is exactly.

She basically shut me down in front of everyone. So, after that I took a big hit emotionally. Also, it was 5am and I was really wasted, and REALLY tired. So, I decided to finish my beer and head to my car to take a nap. I wanted to sleep off my feelings and alcohol. I turned the car on just for the AC, I wasn’t going to drive. I leaned the seat back and proceeded to fall asleep.

Next thing I know, a couple of M’s friends are knocking on my car window telling me to wake up, turn off my car, and come back inside to sleep. I was like okay, I didn’t think M wanted me to sleep over, but I was so tired and drunk that I wasn’t going to question a bed. 

I went back inside her house and went to her room to sleep. She wasn’t there, but her kid was asleep on the bed and my DUMBASS drunk self thought that it would be okay to just lay down next to her. 

I want to take this moment to express my conviction that pedophilia and child molestation is NOT OKAY. Period.

Anyways, I didn’t take off my clothes for obvious reasons. If you’re wondering why I made the decision to sleep in that bed, it’s because my thought process was that M would come to bed and see me and her kid sleeping and she’d think it was adorable. WRONG. Oh my fucking god WRONG.

Jesus Christ, the shit storm that ensued will forever fuck my shit up. Her friend came in the room, saw me laying down, ran out, told M, and were telling me to leave. 

In front of everyone I was told to leave and holy shit I was so embarrassed. M told me that it was NOT okay to do that, and is pretty much pissed to the high heavens at me.

SPACKlick,c80fya,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but a dozen or so years ago but I've recently had to go through medical records which reminded me of it.

As a teenager one of my chores was to clean all the sinks(5), toilets(3), baths(1) and showers(2) in the house. I hated doing it because I had eczema and if I wore rubber gloves the humid sweat would make my hands itch but if I didn't the cleaning liquids would make them red raw. While working at a royal fast food place I found that one of their cleaners didn't mess with my skin so stole a few sachets to make up at home for cleaning with.

All's going well with the upstairs bathroom and en suite. So I move on to the downstairs toilet. Give the bowl a good scrub with this anti-limescale bleach and then pour on some of the sanitising scrub from work to do the rim and seat with.

Instantly I knew I'd fucked up. The water in the bowl fizzed and it felt like my eyes were melting. See what I hadn't appreciated was that the cleaning stuff from work would break down in the anti-limescale stuff and release chlorine gas. Downstairs toilet was a small room, maybe 1.5m long and 50cm wide. The only ventilation was a window behind the toilet that was too high for me to easily reach.

My dumbass made the whole thing worse though. Because my first thought wasn't ""Shit I could die"" or ""Better get out of here"" it was ""I can't open the door or Mum will smell it and I'll be in trouble"". So I sat in the corner at the far end from the toilet covering my eyes and hacking my lungs up for what felt like 10 minutes but realistically cant have been more than 30 seconds.

When I did come out, my eyes were burning red and I felt like my lungs had melted and the goop was sitting in my airway. So we had to take a trip to A&amp;E and I needed two inhalers for about 6 months till my lungs had fully healed. And I had to clean the car for about 6 months because I did get in trouble with my Mum.

seesame,c9mnbc,"This happened 4 years ago. I am from Turkmenistan and was studying in Turkey. I went home for summer vacation. We live in a small city, in middle of nowhere. Since the city is in the desert, my father bought land near the riverside. We went there almost every day, trying to plant something. Only one who were living there was old couple. They were very lovely and lonely couple so every time they see us, they come together with something to eat and chat. One day she said **""Today Ramadan feast I suppose""**, because she saw some religious programs on TV. We had lunch at theirs house and she opened TV. It was ""Lailat Al Miraj *(Islamic holiday)""* and I explained her that it is not Ramadan, it is holiday where Prophet Mohammad ride his horse to sky to meet with Allah... *(not much people where I live cares about religion. Religion only for ""circumcision"",""Ramadan"",""Kurban"" and ""death"")*. I explained her as much I know and she listened carefully and then we went to home.

The next day the door rang in the evening. Surprise, our guests were old couple. Both dressed in religious clothing *(as I mentioned above, if they are dressed up like this, someone must be dead)*. We asked if everything is ok, then old woman cried and hugged me. Turns out she had a dream about my yesterday *""Prophet with horse""* story. But instead of prophet she saw me, sitting on a white horse with long white beard and sceptre on my hand. She says that I blessed her. My dad making jokes that I suppose to enter young girls dreams instead of old woman. Anyway we sat down, entertained the guests, laughed at this event, they went home at night. I thought this was over...

After 1-2 days later, a group of headscarved *(wearing turban)* women came home.When I asked what is happening, my mother said that they came here to see me. This old womans dream event has spread throughout the city, and these women have come to receive my blessing. They brought with them the Koran and they asking from me to read it. I have no idea what to do, even if I say I don't know Arabic, this time they tried to squeeze money under the mat. They didn't believe me then I went out quietly and hung out with friends until night. When I came home they were gone. I thought again, thank God this is over...

The next day the police came home. They took me to the KGB office in town. **Must go!** The officer asked my name, asked what I was doing in Turkey, asked where I was staying in Istanbul. And finally he asked **""Are you Wahhabist or ISIS member?!""** **""I have nothing to do with any of them, why?""** I said. He says **""You gather people and teach them religion, teach them how to read the Koran and making money of it. Who do you work for?!""** and he continued questioning me. It was bit scary. I'm trying to explain it, but he doesn't believe me. Thank God my dad showed up *(he is important man in city)*, explained situation to officer. Story checked out and they released me. It was scary but memorable moment.

For the last two weeks I haven’t been able to have sex due to getting the IUD (couldn’t have sex a week before or after). I’ve got sensitive skin so we try a different washing powder every time we run out until we find one we both like, and we recently started a new brand called Aware. His work uniform weas washed in the last round of our Omo powder, but he got his underwear fresh out of the dryer in the morning.


Yesterday he comes home from work and sits down at the computer, then he starts sniffing the air. 


BF: do I smell like vagina? Smell me

Me, knowing we haven’t had sex in a while: what do you mean?

BF: I’ve smelt vagina all day and I need to know if it’s just my brain. 


I smell him and, yeah, he smells like vagina. Not bad vagina, like it wasn’t a soiled panties after a long camping trip smell, fresh vagina which made it worse in my mind. He insists he has no idea why he could be smelling like that, especially considering it’s only below the belt, and I have to reason with myself that if he were cheating he wouldn’t make me smell the evidence. 


He comes home from work again tonight and he smells entirely like vagina! He starts telling me he has no idea where the smell is coming from, but I’m obviously fucking pissed considering he also finished late the last two nights. He seems genuinely confused too, so I once again try to let it go but it’s really bugging me. We have dinner but it’s pretty awkward, not much talking. He puts the washing on and gets into the shower. 


Once the machine is done I go to put the load in the dryer, and immediately the smell hits. I smell the washing powder too. Vagina. I’ve never been so relieved to realise our new washing powder is making all our clothes smell like pussy. I run through the house with an armful of soaking wet laundry, and excitedly shove them in his face. He’s just as relieved to find out he’s not going crazy!

This bird in particular that was basically a dog. It never wanted to be in the cage, would steal food from our plates, and I swear it knew how to fetch.
It always made a bunch of noise at night unless it was sitting on me or one of my brother while we slept. It would usually sit on our shoulders or on our feet. Well one night, it decided it wanted to sleep on my shoulders. My dad let it into the room I was in and went to bed himself. Some time in the middle of the night, he walked into my room and found that I had rolled onto the bird. I was around 10 years old and slept so heavy that I didn't notice.

I woke the next morning before school to have my dad tell me the bird died by falling between the wall and bed and being young, I didn't realize that the bird would have just fallen to the floor and crawled out from under the bed. We buried it and had a small funeral for it. I just never knew I was the one who killed our best bird.

Since there is no limit in the walmart change room on how many items you can take in I had like 12 or so items. It was alot of stuff and not enough hooks and I like to keep everything organized so I don't mix up the sizes, so I can make a pile of what I'm keeping and not keeping, and to make sure I put everything back on the hangers (I get to keep the hangers too). So all the stuff I was keeping was on a pile on the floor, and I squatted down in my thong, ass facing the door so I could put it all back on the hangers. I was so focused on what I was doing and thinking blissfully about how great it is I'm getting all this clothes for dirt cheap.

Without thinking, I threw on my favorite one and went to spend the 4th with my very Midwestern family.

As I got out of the car, I could see all of their faces drop and genuinely didn't know why everyone was treating me so weirdly until my brother pulled me aside, barely able to contain his laughter, and told me how awesome my joke was. He and I are the family liberals and they all think we're very anti-American as it is. Still didn't get it. He gestured to my shirt and I turned about as red as the stripes on the flag itself.

I kept it on and pretended like it was a liberal college student stunt I was pulling because my family would have assumed it was anyways even if I told them otherwise.

It still comes up every year on the 4th and probably will until the end of eternity. I don't know what happened to the shirt but I wish I had it so I could wear it today.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my friends and I send each other memes. It's what normal teenage boys do these days, right? I'll be scrolling through Reddit, come across a post that I think a friend would find funny, and screenshot / send it to them. Not really a big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend, (we'll call him X for anonymity), that I've known since Kindergarten. We're good friends. Some of my other friends, however, don't like him very much. He's a little dorky like me, and he doesn't always like going out with me and my other friends, so I don't hang out with him as much as others. Because of this, a smaller group chat spawned without him, where we discuss things like sports and partying. For the fourth of July, my sister's friend said she could host a party and asked me who to invite. I sent a message into this smaller chat to see who would be around. I screenshot the responses for later reference and go on my merry way.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where the fuck up occurs. I'm scrolling through Reddit, I find a meme ([it's a stupid math meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathmemes/comments/c6fwz3/the_only_mistakes_i_make_are_on_trivial_questions/)) and I immediately think to send it to him. I save the pic, go to text him the meme, and I select the latest image added and mindlessly hit send.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, fuck. That's not a meme. That's the screenshot from the smaller group chat. Before I could even think to react, X immediately replies, and I'm gonna paraphrase here, ""What the ACTUAL FUCK is wrong with you, LysanderTheGreat?"" I look back at the picture, and sprinkled in the mixture of texts, it contains the following messages from two of our mutual ""friends"": (responses paraphrased)

&gt;(Friend 1) Oh, I'd be down. Just make sure X isn't going, LysanderTheGreat.  
&gt;  
&gt;(Friend 2) \^\^\^ Yeah I'm not going if X comes.  
&gt;  
&gt;(Friend 1) He wouldn't want to come anyway. Thanks for dealing with him all the time, LysanderTheGreat.

Immediately, I feel like the biggest jerk on the face of the earth. I send him the actual meme, explain that the screenshot wasn't meant for him, all the while practically hyperventilating. He wasn't having ANY of it. Those few hours of radio silence on his end were some of the most deafening. I thought that I was going to lose my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

He calls me back, explains that he's not mad at me, but he's not talking to those two people ever again. He asks a few clarifying questions, like who else is in the group chat and who else has been talking shit, etc. I explain the entire situation, and balance is seemingly restored. I'm going to hang out with him this 4th of July, not because I feel obligated, but because I realized that if he can forgive me after THAT, then he's an awesome friend to be around. Friend 1 and Friend 2 have also stopped talking to me after being confronted by X, and now they think I chose X over them.

TL;DR- I have a friend that doesn't go out much, and accidentally sent him a screenshot of me and some other of his friends say that they don't want to hang out with him and that I ""put up"" with him.

Lemiius,c7kqjl,"If you aren't familiar with the ""Major Tom"", it's because it's a thing I (hopefully) came up with. It's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

Basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. This part is called ""Getting in the shuttle.""

As you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. This is considered ""Take off.""

If performed correctly, you should become VERY lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. This is called ""Being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

This is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **I, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. You see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. No oxygen = no consciousness.

When I ""Took off"" I fucking jumped up at Mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. Because the next thing I know I was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

Before I could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if I was okay. She heard my re-entry. This part is called ""Disappointing your mother.""

You can just imagine the scene she walked into.

She stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. I stared back with what I thought was confidence like I was Buzz Aldrin and just got back from the moon. But thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while I was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (At least not to my knowledge.)

She ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more Judge Judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. I cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. Somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and I managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

I'm currently writing this in my room right now, and I don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until I can think of what to say to her. If there is anything to say at all.

Tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. I tried explaining to him I just see the colors automatically when I visualize the letters in my head.

I checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and I just couldn't find her.

Turns out the small lump that I thought was just a pile of blankets since I didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. She sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

I had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

throwawayy_farawayy,c5toeo,"[THE UPDATE!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh where do I begin. This happened this weekend.

Let's lay out some plot points first..

\-I'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. She is 26.

\-I work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. I've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-I've always worked out, done yoga, I'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. This combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. I've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. I know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, I've done it a lot and I know what I'm doing, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

OKAY. So, the girl I am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. One of whom is getting married soon. She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. I was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? I agree to the plan. I was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. This way, I would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. But the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (I can draw a diagram if needed.)

&amp;#x200B;

So the day comes, I have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. By the time I arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. I prepare myself with the girl I'm dating, and she invites her friends in. They are hooting and hollaring as I'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. The whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, I'm really into this idea now.

&amp;#x200B;

I throw my legs over my head as I've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... I circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. I put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and I hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. I'm trying to look back to see them, but I'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. I start getting more and more into it, and the girl I'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. At this point I'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. The girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&amp;#x200B;

After a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""Cum in your mouth! Cum in your mouth!""... Now to be clear, I normally don't do this. I have before, lol, but it's not my thing. But I'm the entertainment, and I aim to please, so in my mind I'm thinking lets do this. I start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. The girl I'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. The whole thing is so hot and I feel like I'm about to cum, and.....explode. It was a lot. I'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. The girl I'm dating let's go of my legs and I fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. Her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - I'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. So I stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and I look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. My assistant.

&amp;#x200B;

She leaves the room, I race to the bathroom. The girl I'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and I tell her. She loses it laughing - ""SO AND SO is your assistant?! AHAHAHAH"". I'm not laughing. Assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&amp;#x200B;

It's actually a bit of a scene, the girl I'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling Assistant and she is not answering. The girl I'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working from home all week. I've talked to my assistant via Slack and we've said nothing. She is in the office. I can't work from home tomorrow. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. The girl I'm dating said that Assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. I really don't know what the fuck to do.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr - I sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. We haven't spoken about it since.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  [The diagram](https://imgur.com/a/rR31eBi)!  I'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  I'm not a turkey, I promise.

EDIT 2: To clarify, I don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  I think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  The diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until I stood up.  At least this is the logic I am convincing myself of.

EDIT 3:  I'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl I am dating"" because honestly I wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  I don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

EDIT 4:  Yes, they were staring at my butthole.  I'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. To be honest if,

EDIT 5:

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts.  No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement.  A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  Better than jerking off that's for sure.

And yes, I have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

NightHunt2099,c37gl2,"So didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. I invited a close friend to the movies with me. A few odd things happened, and it wasn't until I spoke to a friend of mine that I realized I missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) Beforehand, I jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and I got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). She replies ""Don't worry, if that were you and I, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. I laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) Driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. I replied, ""I guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. She then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in [my car] though"". I then replied ""You know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn't thirsty.

TLDR: I missed strong signs that she was dtf


Edit: There is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

hymness1,c43efz,"This happened 2 days ago. So last week I found a thong on the floor in my living room. Smelt it like the animal I am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

Huh... I found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? It was clean so I put it in your drawer. What it's not yours?

Angrily, she answers it's not hers. You just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

I tell her what the hell am I suppose to say. She goes back upstairs really angry at me.

So last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. I send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. It is. We're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... We came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

Now the real fuck up. My wife is in the bed. I go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. Just texted her and the thong is hers. The only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE

Jesus Christ, I don't even believe my explanation myself. I tell her to believe what she wants, I don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that I don't have anything to redeem myself. I take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

The next morning she calls me. She tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that I'd put it in her drawer. And if I was cheating on her, I'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. Asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

TLDR : Found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. Almost lost my wife to it.

EDIT : OMG it exploded. Thanks for the silver mystery redditors! I know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! Had fun with the others that told similar stories :) And yes, I told my friend that I sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

EDIT2 : The [thong](https://imgur.com/a/KtGzDeU) in question

EDIT 3 : Wow thanks for the gold! I answered to a bunch of you, but I'll not be able to keep up! There's too many comments! I hope you guys have a nice day!

EDIT4 : addressing some comments. No I don't think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. Yes I have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. My wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them. Finally, my friend's fabric softener is Fleecy.",tifu,TIFU by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer
AwayTheThrow920,byxons,"Now this TIFU didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

So, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.

This is where the fuck up happens.

After around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

I'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

She starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. 

Right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

I sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

Although me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

TL;DR - GF was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and I ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",tifu,TIFU by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother
-BlackRaven,c2a2dy,"TL;DR at the bottom.

So I have a friend from high-school that I haven't seen in forever. He is an absolute master of kindness. Driving for two hours to get you out of trouble after not seeing you for over three years type of kindness. Top bloke. Best dude you'll ever meet. Wouldn't hurt a fly. You get the picture.

Today he posted a super ecstatic picture of him and his wife with the caption ""About to be a family of three! Finally!""

His face is big. Double chin kind of big and very unlike him. He was always slim and fit growing up and this just looked fake and not at all like him. It looked so unlike him I automatically assumed this was on of those ridiculous Snapchat filters all the cool kids are using and that he had jokingly used it for a fun twist, so I commented something along the lines of ""Congratulations man! Let's just hope the kid doesn't get your chin lol!""

I close my phone and go back to work. His sister pops up in my chat in the meantime. Tells me he gained a lot of weight from depression, mainly from finding out he was close to being sterile. They've been trying for a kid for two years, almost breaking up multiple times.

 I jumped back to my fb to remove the comment only to find out he deleted the entire post.

I wanna die. I'm on my way over there to apologize. Wish me luck. Or death.

Edit: changed my wording about his appearance. I was in shock when I wrote this and I was an asshole.

Edit 2: thanks for confirming my suspicion that I am indeed a fucking moron. I agree. I'll update once something new happens. Surprisingly talking to me isn't his top priority at the moment so you will all have to suffer the wait with me.

--

Edit 3: The update. The encounter.

I sent him a message after I realized I had fucked up. I am a firm believer in apologizing for your mistakes in person and so I simply asked if he'd have me over later that day and that I owed him an apology for the childish way I congratulated him on those fantastic news.

He was radio silent for a few hours but just as I was about to step into my shuttle and move from the planet he sent me a message and invited me for a drink at his local bar. 

I took just about all of your advices. He lives in the next town over so on my way there I bought a bottle of scotch and wrapped it up as a ""congratulations on the baby"" gift instead of ""sorry I fucked up"" one.

Long story short I show up and he is super excited to see me. Big bear hug and all. He loves the gift. Chats enthusiastically as we sit down. I expected a punch in the face at best and I am so confused. We spend a little while catching up until I stop him and just straight up apologize for my stupid comment. Tell him I feel awful that I said that and explain I meant nothing by it and how his kid is gonna grow up to be a fantastic piece of human miracle. I'm just about to offer my life in return for his apology when he stops me.

His reaction? He stared at me for an eternity (or ten seconds) before he absolutely lost his shit. He laughed so hard I was pretty sure he was gonna run out of air and die right there. He's holding his stomach and his laugh is so intense it turns into one of those silent wheezing sounds that only dogs can hear.

Turns out he didn't even see my comment. His wife deleted the original post because some ex of hers was posting shit and then posted it again on her private wall (friends only). Yeah. She posted it and and tagged my friend, not the other way around. She also seems to have just deleted my comment without telling him before that or something. What a fucking saint that woman is.

So. No harm done. I showed him this thread and he didn't stop laughing for about two hours. He shared this on his Facebook and tagged me and got his revenge that I so generously handed to him on a silver plate because he didn't even fucking know. You guys. He didn't even know. He doesn't care. He thinks my original comment was hilarious. He is a little pissed at his sister for contacting me and making it look like I wrecked havoc.

So yeah. I just arrived home drunk, tired and super fucking happy that this couple is having a kid. He's gonna be the best dad ever (whatever his chin looks like).

Thanks for joining me on this roller coaster Reddit. I've learned my lesson.

3ar3ara_G0rd0n,c5ckus,"This actually happened over Christmas last year.

My family, including (paternal) my grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having Christmas dinner. 

My grandfather brought up that he did AncestryDNA (or was it 23and me?). I don't remember the exact one, because I can barely think about it. It's hard just writing this up.

It was really cool to hear what he found. He found mostly Scandinavian spread out over the British isles, particularly Wales. We knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% Persian! Very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. He's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

The only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of King George III. The reason why I question this is King George III is recorded as one of the few Kings who never had a mistress. 

However, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of King George III (we are descended from the woman). He mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

ANYWAY, off topic. I thought it was fascinating, and I love hearing what he's found. I brought up possibly using my Christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. I don't think I was really going to do it, I usually use the money to pay bills.

Silence. And it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. Everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

My sister and I look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. My parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. We look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. I have weird Hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. My sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

I always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. I never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair I have such cool pretty eyes. 

Well, okay.

Dad starts first. Dad (D), Mom (M), Sister (S), and Me.

D: There's a chance 3ar3ara_G0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

S and Me: Imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. My sister grabs my hand (I love her big sister ways).

Me: Okay, um... 

D: Your mom never had an affair. This isn't some cheating story.

Me: Wha.. (I start to feel very sick).

M: I hoped to never have to tell you this. I was raped. The reason we're not sure is because your dad and I had sex earlier that day.

Me: (I want to die, I start crying). Everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

D: Your grandparents know.

S: Okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

M: No, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

Me: He's still out there?

S: But obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

My dad and mom look at each other. 

M: It was my brother.

I felt so sick. I felt... dirty. I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I couldn't stop shaking. My sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. We probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

Our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

The rest of the vacation was just weird. If it weren't for my nephews, I'm pretty sure I would have just gone home.

Oh my nephews are wonderful.

Well, we came home, and I had to battle with the ""Do I want to know?"" thoughts. I could get a DNA test. But I couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. But it weighed on me too much. I had to know in order to move forward. So I asked my dad if he would submit his DNA with mine. We weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. It was hard asking him to not say anything to her. He should be able to talk to his wife.

So we submitted the test. 

I am my father's daughter. I cried when I got the results. It was a huge weight off my shoulders.

I made a decision not to tell my dad - I wanted to surprise them. I kept saying I hadn't gotten the results back. I did tell my sister though.

I gave them the piece of paper on Mother's Day. I was going to wait until Father's Day, but I couldn't. So I got a blank card. 

Inside I wrote: ""Mom, Open the paper."" She opened it and I had written Happy Mother's Day, and Happy Early Father's Day. 

Lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

Thank God.

EDIT: left out half a sentence, oops. 

It was my uncle on my mother's side. I have met him. My sister and I were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

Family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

My parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. Two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. Incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there I guess was his reason. Plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

My mom didn't go No Contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. Why that long, I have no idea. Those are her reasons. 

She did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. I guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

Grandmother is dead now.

This happened in Louisiana.

ohhhmgod,c4twsv,"(UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)

This happened yesterday. I can't wait until it's much further away than that.

So this is a throwaway, I have \*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.

So I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

She is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office ""XXX,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.

Most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

So along comes yesterday, the big day. I'm so worked up. She's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I'm in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I'm beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office ""XXX"" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can't be, I think.

So I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I'd stop by!"" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""OMG COUSIN!"" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

I race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don't think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don't know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We're supposed to get a drink tonight. I'm petrified and don't know how in god's name I will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  It's hard to reply to all of the comments, so I'll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it's a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.

Yes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i’m going to be honest.  I don’t know.

edit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can’t really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)

• She doesn’t have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• She lives in NYC, it’s big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn’t occur to me, I guess I was worked up.

• I come here often, it’s not that I didn’t call her, but sometimes when i’m here she’ll dm or comment on my insta story and say “hey come by and visit next time”

oooookay, so now onto drinks.

I decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn’t fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn’t buy the “i just popped in”.  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn’t, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it’s a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we’ll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.

RollingLucyTree,bzhc06," So here's the deal, my friends and I made a cannabis cake containing 8g of good flower. So I kinda forgot about it and left a piece in the fridge, to my surprise I come home today and the piece is gone.

What should I tell them. Or should I tell them at all? They are anti cannabis.

Help.

Update: My father found a joint in the ash tray and I just said it's from my friends. He said that cannabis is a shit drug and doesn't want me to smoke this ""shit"". Well if he would know that he just had a piece of ""shit"" cake...

Update 2: My father is going around our house with a candle and Christian church songs. I'm holding my laugh back

Update 3: My mom just made burgers for us and my dad never ate a single one apart from those like from McDonald's (2 times). He said that it's the most delicious thing he has ever eaten.

Update 4: My dad is just chilling right now and talking with my mum. My mum, I think, hasn't felt anything. 
Will update tomorrow. Good night folks. 

Update 5: I talked a little bit with my parents and they don't seem to suspect anything. Guess I got away.

Peleaon,c7tjlr,"I don't know if Meta threads are allowed, but I think this needs to be said. I believe the removal of the ""NSFW only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. The majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting TIFUs that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. Nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, TIFUs that are actually not TIFUs at all and serve only as humble brags - TIFU by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool I am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. Sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have &gt;50% posts on this sub.

When you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling OP out for the story obviously being fake/barely a TIFU (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so I really doubt I am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

TL;DR: Personally I think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the NSFW weekend rule. These post clearly have their audience so I have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. However I don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",tifu,TIFU by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments [META]
A_Sad_Frog,c0ybsw,"UPDATE POST HERE:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\_update\_letting\_my\_nephew\_use\_my\_fortnite/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   


Maybe you already know where this is going.

My niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. They're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. My niece (who we'll call L), and my nephew (who we'll call W) don't have many games on their PSN account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle I am, I game them access to my PSN account, to play my far superior collection of games.All was well for about a month. I knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

But imagine my surprise yesterday when I get this message on facebook...

&amp;#x200B;

""A\_Sad\_Frog, can you check your bank? ""

It was my brother in law. L and W's father.

""W is playing Fortnite and he has 65,000 V bucks, is this normal?""

&amp;#x200B;

My heart stopped. Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.[I went to my transaction history on PSN, and nearly threw up when I saw this](https://imgur.com/a/qZu4SCN)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&amp;#x200B;

All told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. By the time I got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. I saw that the Playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. That's **FU number 1.**""Tell them to stop what they're doing. Shut off your PS4. I have to sort this out"".

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **NOTHING**. PlayStation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. This is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherF\*ng V bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. For all intents and purposes, I have lost that money. The bank can't do anything about it.

So here's where it gets really messed up. **FU number 2**. My girlfriend is visiting family in the US, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. She will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. That was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than I ever could have expected, and far better than I deserved.

I'm not mad at the kids. I genuinely don't think they meant it. I'm mad at myself. I didn't think it was possible, but then I should have done more research. I feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just F'ed. We're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

So, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on PSN are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**TLDR:** Left my PlayStation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. This is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. It would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **FU number 3** confirmed.

**UPDATE #1:** Playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when I can contact them.",tifu,"TIFU by letting my niece and nephew use my PSN account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday."
FastWalkingShortGuy,c6t0m7,"Okay, so by TIFU standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony I unintentionally put myself through, I think it qualifies.

I have fairly weird-sized feet.  They're very wide, but not all that long.  I have no arch to speak of.  I'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  I'm pretty short so I should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

Wrong.

When I was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure I had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

As an adult, I assumed, well, since I'm full-grown, I should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  For me, that's a size 10 (US).

Problem was, I kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, I'll switch to size 10W.

Still no luck.  Still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  My running shoes were so ill-fitted that I actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

My friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5W Nikes.  I said, ""Sure, fuck it, I'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

Oh.  My.  God.

It was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  I was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  I had no idea how much misery I had been in until I wore those shoes.  I wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because I was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  There's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

TL;DR - I'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years I have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because I was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",tifu,TIFU by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.
fridayyyy,c0idg0,"This actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. I was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. We got on well and I was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country I decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. I thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so I kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

In the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. It was all a blur but I kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what I think. Well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided NOT to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). We met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but I was prepared and considered that was it.

The box stayed in my fridge for I dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? She went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and I also met somebody else. One day I was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. Chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously I still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then I saw a full page note from her. She basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

I just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. I probably looked like an asshole for how I acted when I last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am I..

J_T_09,byii3u,"Like all good TIFUs, this didn’t happen yesterday.

My wife and I went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  It’s just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

One of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

On this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.

Apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

My wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that’s fair.

I’m not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.

TL;DR:  Went to dinner and played duck calls.  Called in another drake and ruined a family.

PM_ME_YER_TITTAYS,c6izh3,"So this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

I visited Thailand in September '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. This meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and I never felt OK jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so I decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. I was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

One morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on Koh Samui, I decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. After a little splash around I used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, I didn't think much of it. I then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious Pad Thai.

I suffer from ongoing back pains, so when I hit Thailand I took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. Now, considering how vulgar my username is, I am actually bit of a prude. I didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once I start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? Not that I'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. So, after being a little drunk and full of food I decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

This wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. I went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. I asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought I was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. It was only when I started taking my sweatpants off that I remembered that I was free-balling, I explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst I awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

The first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones I'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (I'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), I was in absolute bliss. Then came the time for the front. Look, by this point I had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. With this massage I was at absolute full-mast. One of those ""I've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. I apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. She laughed and started working on my legs, I started relaxing a bit more, I imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. She went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch I imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. I went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

Cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that I thought I'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but I also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. All the while I'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. Mostly despair. After a short while, the fireworks were over. There was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. I realised that I'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this Gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. Wordlessly I put my clothes on, not making eye contact, I pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 Baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. I often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

Edit - Typos  


Edit 2 - After desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as I could, I received a notification that I'd hit the front page. So, I guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, I still need to work too. In all honesty, I wrote up this event because I had been told I had to during one of the many times I have regaled people with it. I had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so I posted it typos and all. I did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and I am grateful beyond words. Every little complement and giggle is doing more good than I think most people would realise. Thank you.

Tornado_Of_Benjamins,c2hg5s,"This is literally still happening. Maybe it will continue for the rest of my life. Maybe this is it for me.

So I live in an apartment-style dorm, but my roommates do not move in for a few more weeks so I am alone in my unit for now. This is very clear because there is a placard with my name and my name only on the front door.

This morning I woke up to the sounds of clanging and walking in my unit. I panicked before my mind supplied ""oh that's the janitor that comes to clean the bathrooms on Monday's"". 

And I immediately suffer a heart attack.

It is Wednesday. 

I was not expecting a janitor visit. 

In the tub, drying overnight, I had arranged a smorgasbord of sex toy delights: anal beads, a plug, and four dragon/monster dildos of increasing size. Lined up. Like little sex soldiers.

I hear her open the door to the bathroom, and I lay in the bed in my locked room quiet and still. Maybe I'll can stop existing.

I hear some noise, and what sounds like talking.

A few minutes later I hear my RA walk in. I hear some comments and some laughter. They quietly convene for what feels like a long while. The RA simply laments ""why?!"" and the  janitor asks if any boys live in the unit. I continue not to breathe. There are four bedrooms and they don't know which one I use and all the doors are closed so if I continue to be quiet I can astral project off this plane of existence without them noticing.

I currently hear the sounds of a spray bottle, occasionally followed by bag rustling and the tell-tale sound of unsticking a six pound hunk of silicon from a tub. I don't know when she'll leave, if ever. I think I'll be trapped here forever, sweating under the covers from anticipation and embarrassment while she talks and laughs and cleans around my monster dildos.

Please send me instructions on how to dissolve into the floor, thanks and have a lovely afternoon.

TL;DR: Left all my sex toys out overnight so of course the janitor made a surprise visit this morning and invited the RA to come look at my dragon cocks.

-- / -- / -- / -- / --

UPDATE: Oh my god this absolutely blew up. I'm going to give an update and answer some questions because I think my phone is going to explode.

-- I emerged from my room about an hour later, my toys were as I left them and there was cleaner in the toilet, so my understanding is that the janitor cleaned the bathroom and perhaps lifted the toys to clean underneath them. I rinsed my things and put them hidden in a drawer in my room. I was waiting to update because I half-expected some communication from my RA but this hasn't happened. Sorry the ending isn't juicier but honestly I wouldn't have been able to handle it so I'm thankful.

-- The janitor coming in unannounced is standard procedure. I still have no clue why the RA was allowed in; I'm starting to believe maybe it was, in fact, another janitor? The voice was hushed and I may have misidentified it.

-- A lot of you want pics of the toys. I have a pic of the four in question in a post I made a month or so ago. Yes I recommend them, yes they are worth the money.

-- I am FTM, so I am a guy but I currently still have my vagina. I didn't mention my sex or gender because for many reasons it was irrelevant to the story. I put the toys wherever I decide I want them. This clarification is here so that discussion and speculation in the comments is no longer necessary. Comments about this aren't going to spark fun or interesting conversations so if you want to argue go do it on a debate forum, not on a funny dildo story.

Fast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.
Im sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.

Que fuck up.
I never changed todds name back. Its been a running joke between us for years.
So ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. She freaks out. Comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". She runs off upstairs.
So im sitting there really confused. After a few seconds i follow her upstairs. I can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
Now im really confused. I get to the bedroom. My partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". I piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old &amp; he's been my best friend my whole life cause I'm 22. so he's all old &amp; fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, I was cleaning my T-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. I thought, ""man, Buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so I proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. I proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (QUICKLY for his age &amp; condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so I didn't expect this, but I suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. I'm watching him eat it cause I'm all stoked he's enjoying himself &amp; feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air &amp; starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk Irishman.   I instantly take action &amp; start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so I grab the fucker &amp; tug it out. he's unresponsive &amp; his eyes are all rolled back. I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. so i start giving him CPR. (I don't know how to do CPR for humans, let alone a dog, but I gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again &amp; looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day I die. he lays there for a second &amp; I rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug I gave to that t-bone fat strip). &amp; this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat I ripped from his throat, &amp; starts going at it again. but much slower &amp; more cautious this time. I monitored him the whole time &amp; then got him some water to wash it all down. I gave him some love &amp; he went to sleep.

mlinuga,c62vbq,"Not today, but Black Mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and I just remembered my fuck up. 

Said episode was ""Shut up and Dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. Because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

Now, I don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. So the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""Sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

Had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

I think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

Well, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

We were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.

throwawayy_farawayy,c682li,"Amidst the hate and questioning of my sexuality, there was actually some fantastic advice in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5toeo/tifu_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my_new/). I came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what I was going to say. I felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer I got, the more fucking petrified I became. The walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if I was in there first, and maybe if I was first it would seem more intimidating. My mind was going nuts. I got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. Just a fucking horrible way to start this.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. I honestly wish I could tell you all exactly what I said but I really don’t remember. I know I apologized, I said something along the lines of each of us probably don’t want to ever have to look at each other again, and I did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, I’d be happy to help her find another job. She asked if I wanted her to leave and I said of course not.

&amp;#x200B;

She was kind of looking down the whole time and after I finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said “what are the fucking odds.” We both started laughing and I came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. We agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, Ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. Then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. Ohhh boy, lol, but sure.

* When did i learn i could do this?
* Have i ever done this for a crowd before?

and of course...

* Does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?

and..

* Are you bi? Do you think it’s kind of gay?

&amp;#x200B;

I obliged, I think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her how long she has known my friend for. (They met in college). She said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. She said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. I got the feeling this wasn’t the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.

&amp;#x200B;

I really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but I was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters I don’t think I want to know the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and no, I do not know if she’s on Reddit. I felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr - I did my best, she did hers, it’s awkward but it’ll all be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  Okay, I'll answer the questions.

I learned with my girlfriend in college.  We were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  It's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.

&amp;#x200B;

Never done it for a crowd before, no.

&amp;#x200B;

(from the original post)

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts. No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward. By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement. A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. Better than jerking off that's for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2:  Guys, ""party trick"" is just a saying.   This is the only party I have ever done this.

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I’ve had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (I don’t have them and I don’t want to see them again).

The truth is there isn’t much of an update because I never confronted her about it. I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

Our sex life is back to normal and I feel like I’ve mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  

I thought I would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.

—

WHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?

Honestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I’m as bad as her.

HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?

Because I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

WAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?

No

YOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG

2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.

As you can imagine, I’ve also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  

A DICK THAT BIG COULDN’T GET HARD

It certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you’re right.

HER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING

She probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I’ve been with. I guess you don’t know how vaginas work.

Someone told me that my original post was the most upvoted NSFW post in the history of Reddit. I don’t know if that’s true, but I guess that’s pretty cool.

gothgf3000,c77x6d,"A couple months ago, it was date night with my bf and I was PUMPED to finally relax after a rough week. My boyfriend (who asked to be called Magnum here 🙄 🙄so I'll refer to him as M) and I ended up making stuffed crust pizza. With grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. So does M, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.

&amp;#x200B;

After blowing him, I pulled off to swallow, but I couldn't -- my jaw was locked wide open!

&amp;#x200B;

Super embarrassed, I ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. It was still stuck in the back of my throat, but I couldn't swallow or spit, so I tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.

&amp;#x200B;

We try everything—forcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to Jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it's still stuck wide open. Trying to make a little more tolerable, I took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting I can't swallow. So there I was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. To make matters worse, M eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously I can't have any.

&amp;#x200B;

At \~4am, we give up the home remedies and Uber to the ER. I attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. She's probably like, ""why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?"" I write down that I'm nauseous and worried I'll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. We end up with an audience of about \~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.

&amp;#x200B;

One asks, ""How did this happen?""

Me: ...

Another doctor: ""Did you yawn?""

Me: ...uh...yeah...

🤦‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

One doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. It hurts like a bitch—this guy's applying his whole body weight into my teeth and I can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.

&amp;#x200B;

But then!! Suddenly everything feels right again. It's all in place!!!

&amp;#x200B;

We go home and the pizza is STILL good the next morning, and everything is okay. Well, besides having to send an ER bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( M looked awfully smug the whole time, but I appreciated him coming w me to the ER and letting me drool all over him

1.

Mispronounced my new girlfriend's name when I introduced her to old friends of mine.

2.

Dropped an F bomb during an important job interview when I accidentally bit my own tongue.

3.

Ignored my broken tooth for weeks and ended up in hospital with inflamed and infected gums. 

4.

Changed my Instagram name to @onetruegenuis and realized I misspelled 'genius' when several of my friends and colleagues jumped on the chance to point out the irony of my illiteracy. 

5.

Unknowingly opened a dick pic sent to me from my father who thought he was sending that shit to my mom. 

6.

Speaking of dick, somehow drunk me managed to get his poor balls stuck on his zipper twice in one night (the second time I had to call my best friend for a helping hand: I said no homo, he did not). 

7.

Took a random ride on my younger cousin's BMX bike, sat my ass down mid-ride, and was painfully reminded there was nothing but exposed steel to fucking sit on (tl:dr got butt raped by BMX).

8.

Suffered an asthma attack while masturbating in the shower and almost blacked out while waiting for my dick to defuse before I had the courage to call my roommate for my inhaler. 

9.

Visited my sister in law who told me not to freak out if her pet bird decides to fly over to sit on my shoulder. The bitch fucking flew like 10 seconds later and I freaked the fuck out. I dodged the damn bird on instinct and inadvertently caused it to fly face first into the window behind me. It survived, but my sister in law made damn sure I didn't.

christmaswarmth,c7h9ew,"This fuck up has been going on my entire life but it just hit me last week so here it goes.

My grandpa is from the south, so he has a bit of an accent and on top of that he’s soft-spoken. This paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. Since I can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said “Hey! Wanna color?” in a really fast manner. Which young me always politely declined. Throughout the years this has continued. I always said no thank you because I have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. Plus, maybe he loves coloring I mean hey, if that’s his thing then so be it even though I’ve never once seen him color.

Then last week it dawned on me. He approached me and said  **“Hey! Wanna color?”**  At least that’s what I registered at first but then I deciphered it correctly. He was actually saying  **“Hey There Young feller”**  .. I  Instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. For my entire life I have been responding to my grandpas greeting with No Thank you.. I explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man I’m never going to live this down.

EDIT: To clear things up people keep asking how would I confuse the two phrases? He talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. So the two together sound somewhat similar. For those saying this is made up I guess believe what you want? I'm not sure why I'd make up such a strange story.

Thanks for the Silver!!

MechanicalMongrel,by813n,"**Gonna use a throwaway. I'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

I had an essay to print out this weekend but since I no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. So, I wasted no time copying all my shit to a USB and grabbing my coat. I was literally just about to shut the door behind me when I heard my roommate calling my damn name. He wanted something printed out as well. A fucking flyer or some shit. Random, but ok whatever. 

He asked if he could use my USB. I didn't see why not, so I said sure. Once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my USB and said: ""Valar Morgulis, motherfucker"". I said: ""Valar Dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. The print shop was busy when I got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. Little did I know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

I handed the cute print shop girl my USB with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. As far as I knew, there was nothing else on the USB except those two documents. Print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. Her expression was unreadable. Like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. She leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""Which two files, sir?"". I replied: ""Only the two you see on there"". 

At that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. Folders that never even existed when I copied my essay. Here's the damn punchline. All these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""TINY TWINK DRILLED HARD BY HANDSOME HANDYMAN""**

**""COLLEGE STUD DRAINS HIS BIG UNCUT COCK""** 

**""CUTE BOY FUCKED IN THE ASS BY DADDY""**

**""TEASING MY DRUNK STRAIGHT FRIEND WITH RAW DICK""**

**""HIGH SCHOOL HUNKS FUCK BAREBACK""** 

**""HUNG DOCTOR GETS HEAD AFTER PHYSICAL""**

**""PLANET OF THE BOTTOMS: DAWN OF DA DICK""** 

There were loads more, but I'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. I shook my head in horror and said: ""That ain't mine"". Print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""What should I print for you, sir?"" 

""It's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""Of course""

*Crickets*

I swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. 

""Print the one called assignment, please. Under, uh... All Ass All Access. Thank you""

**Tl:dr I walked into my local print shop with an essay I had to print out. Walked out looking like a porn addict.**

*Edit: Ya'll giving me too much attention. Appreciate the rewards though. Just wanna provide feedback to some of the comments. I requested that print shop girl expand the display settings to show the number of files in each folder. All the folders had 0 files except one: ""All Ass All Access"". That's how I located my essay.

Also, this throwaway isn't to hide this post from him, I just don't wanna have him think these little stunts of his are worthy of living on the Reddit account I use daily.

wsxedcthrowaway,c3xt1h,"Hey everyone. This happened a few weeks ago but I haven’t had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

In the original post I left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so I will clear those up now. When I went into the room I grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. He stood up and I pushed him down. I went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. Her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. He woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. He was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so I wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. In the car he zipped himself up and I gave him my sweater to wear. I realize now how my original post might sound like I was driving him around unconscious but I would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would’ve been life or death so I’m sorry this was misleading. Hell, I probably wouldn’t have been able to carry him to the car (I’m just a strong but average sized lady :P) Anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the ER for a while. 

The doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn’t have any injuries. He said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn’t hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. Her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. 

After the doctor determined he didn’t have any injuries I called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn’t need to make the long trip. My daughter’s bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.

For my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. She says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. I told her that I didn’t want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it’s a safe place and I don’t want her to feel bad over this. I installed a lock on her door as a little “I’m sorry” gift. I think this is something I should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and I’m glad I’ve got that covered now. I also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. 

For her bf I got him a card, some chocolate, and I paid for him to have a night at an Airbnb with her so they could have a private night together.

Backstory: So our small group of friends includes one girl and 3 guys including me and we make a fair number of sexist and racist jokes. When someone in the group says something and another person misses it and asks to repeat it, we tell that person that ""You know what makes you deaf? Sucking a lot of dick"". Okay saying it like this sounds pretty stupid but believe me it's funny in person.

Eventually a girl comes up and tells me that she thinks my phone is ringing. A normal person would have said ""Ohh thanks"" but what did I say? Of course I said ""Oh well you know I suck a lot of dick"". She just stared at me for a second and then walked to the opposite end of the bus stop. FML.

rogueShadow13,c4lzwm,"So today I woke up at 5 a.m. (about an hour ago). I open reddit before I start getting ready for work. I notice a TIFU [post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) It has a lot of upvotes, so I figure it must be a good one.  

As I’m reading through the post and comments, I realize that have never been able to visualize something or someone. I only see black.  I did not realize that this is not normal. Apparently it’s called aphantasia and it’s relatively rare. Most people see clear images and colors when they’re visualizing something. I’m 22 and did not know this was a thing until I read that post.  I’ve been trying to test myself for the last hour to see if I can “picture” anything. Turns out I can’t. So now I’m sitting here having an existential crisis about all the things I’ll never be able to “see” again.  

TL;DR I read a reddit post and discovered I have aphantasia.


EDIT: a lot of people are asking if I can dream or not.  The answer is sort of.  I do have dreams occasionally and supplements (melatonin/other sleep pills) sometimes make them more vivid, but I don’t recall them at all. The only time I know I have dreamt is when it’s a shocking/scary/exciting dream. I feel something after I wake up, I just can’t recall a damn thing that happened. Sometimes I can remember the premise of the dream, like if it was me working or traveling somewhere, just can’t “see” what I saw when I dreamt.  I think I dream maybe once or twice a month.

EDIT 2:  I understand the difference between visualizing and actually seeing something. *seeing* is just the best word I have to describe what I can’t do in my head.  From memory, I can tell you what something looks like. I just can’t *see* it in my minds eye.

IWantALargeFarva,byrqw6,"TIFU, and it actually happened today. I was driving with my 12 year old daughter. We got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. I glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. It looked like my daughter’s friend Gabe. I said to her, “is that...” and before I could even finish, she said yes. 

So I suggested we say hi to him. I rolled down my window and screamed “Gabe!” The kid turned around, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t Gabe. It was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old. 

So here’s the thing. This kid isn’t Gabe. God only knows if he’s even heard the name Gabe before. And it’s a busy intersection, so it’s noisy. 

The kid had such a puzzled and embarrassed look on his face, and he ran to his car. And that’s when I realized, this 9 year old kid thinks a middle aged woman just rolled down her car window, screamed “gay!!!” at him, and drove away. My daughter laughed her ass off at me.

U_R_MY_BREAST_FRIEND,c2rawz,"TL;DR I took too many edibles, tripped out.

Obligatory it was yesterday yadda yadda yadda.

So to start off I would like to say that I smoke weed about 3-4 times a week. I smoke maybe a gram, or more with friends. I have never smoked so much that I lost control of myself, or couldn't function. I have never thrown up from smoking too much, so I would like to consider myself a heavy weight. However, I had never tried edibles.

I decided to make some at home, because I like cooking, and I decided to make an omelet with canabutter. The recipe said around 4 grams of high THC concentrated grams of weed. I grow my own, and pride myself on a cannabis plant with high THC content, but 4 grams for 1 WHOLE CUP of butter and half a cup of water?!?!? That seemed absurd, and I was eating w a friend, so I used 4 grams for 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of water, thinking I will just be careful with dosing. I invited A, as in ONE, friend over, (let's call him Jason)and we made the omelet. I added about 2 tablespoons of the cannabutter, blended and cooked for a long amount of time I might add, or approximately half into the actual egg mixture (4 eggs and a couple table spoons of sour cream w some spices). I then added a very little bit to melt on the pan, but I thought it couldn't hurt so I added more. Also, the whole time I was thinking my friend would help me finish it.

I made the omelet, we dug in, and then we quickly drove to a nearby chili's because we knew they were strong, and we didn't want to drive under the influence. I got there, and barely ordered our water when everything hit me all at once. I felt like the air became corn syrup. The waitress was standing right next to me, and then I blinked, and I swear on my mother she just teleported to the other side of the table. My friend was obviously also high as a kite. It's hard to explain how high I was, and then I played some games on the little Ipad they had. I sat there, and I kept thinking about how I had to say something or else it would be awkward. Then I started freaking out when one of my other friends got here(I'll go with Clarissa), I had invited her prior but she does not partake in weed. I forgot my Jason was there, because in my mind I only had one friend sitting down w me at Chili's. Then I turned an saw my Jason, and he was just smiling. He said he felt like there were hooks in his cheeks holding his smile up, but it felt good. I asked Clarissa whether or not she felt as if the service was taking forever, but she told me she just sat down. I felt like she was gaslighting me, because I could have sworn we were there for like a  couple hours. I said I needed to take a piss, so I started walking to the bathrooms. That is when I walked into the girl's restroom. Luckily nobody was there, but I was so confused until I realized it was the women's restroom due to the lack of urinals. After washing my hands in what felt like water so hot it was freezing cold I went back to my table. As I sat down, both of my friends were gone. I thought, in my state, they had somehow gotten lost at the table, I honestly don't know how but I distinctly remember thinking that I had to find them or else they would be lost forever. I found my way back to our car, and they were in there. I started knocking and telling them to let me in, but for some reason they wouldn't. Sick of their shit, I started slamming, saying,"" If you fuckers don't let me in I will break this glass."" Then, to my intense horror I realized this was in fact not our car, but somebody else's. I went back inside and sat down, my friends were there. They said they just watched me walk up to the table, say,"" I gotta find them."" and then walk outside. I can confidently say I was high even the next morning, which freaked me out even more. Safe to say I will follow recipes to the T from now on.

Edit: Now I'm kinda mad I used my throwaway account for this.

Edit: I get it, I'm not a heavyweight, hence my overestimation by a long shot. This has turned into a dick length contest- ""You think you're a heavyweight? I smoke 2 oz a week,"" or, "" You think you're a heavy weight? You are fucking stupid you small child, little dick, cunt. I smoke an 1/8 a day, and smoke wax constantly you fucking pussy. I also fucked your girlfriend."" Like jesus calm down.

Edit: Many people doubt this story due to me not describing how I made the cannabutter, all I can say is that this is the story of how I fucked up, not how I made cannabutter. If you must know, yes I decarbed it (55 minutes at 220, in between foil on a baking pan) , then blended, and cooked it in a pan till it browned, dark brown close to a burnt smell, but not. I then blended it again. I didn't have cheescloth to strain, so I didn't extract the weed, just blended it in.  the strain was sour diesal.

We're kind of even because she recently bought a vibrator on the family amazon prime account and accidentally used my credit cards. There is now an unspoken agreement between us to not mention it. My SO and best friend had a good laugh at my embarrassment. Just remember to hide your sex bags better.

RegretfulDecision69,c71xpx,"NSFL? If you're eating something then I'd suggest not reading this.

You ever seen those stories on the reddit museum of filth? Like, the crusty cum shoebox or the Rainbow Dash figure that was boiled in a jar of cum, and realised 'Why is there no female version of this?'. Well, sit down because I'm about to tell you the story of how I inadvertently fucked myself... with a stick full of maggots.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have this pool diving stick that I use to fuck myself. I live with my parents so I can't really get an actual toy. Now, this pool toy has two holes on the 'shaft' to allow water to fill in and out of it so it can sink to the bottom of the pool. This also allows it to fill with my girl juices when I use it. The problem? The fluid gets stuck in there since it's relatively more viscous than water. So I've had this thing for about 6 months. I try my best to clean it out by running it under the tap and rinsing it out every couple of weeks but I can never really get the solidly dry stuff. This, combined with the fact that I always just sort of shoved it down the side of my bed, or stuffed it in my bedside cabinet once I was done with it made for a pretty nasty smell. It wasn't usually that obvious unless you got close, but earlier today, once I had finished fucking myself, I put it in my drawer and sat up in my bed. I noticed that not only did it smelled significantly worse than usual, maybe due to the summer heat, but also 'down there' also felt like it was on fire. Not enough to be painful, but enough for me to notice it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where the interesting part starts. I decide. 'Hey, It's currently 4AM, everyone is asleep, I can go and cut this thing open.' Sort of like a fucked up episode of 'What's Inside'. So I reach into my drawer, grab my phone and make my way downstairs into the kitchen where I clear out the sink and put this thing down in it. I use a pocket knife to start cutting it open, starting from one of the holes on the side. I'm scared to open it, but I understand that I must, and I put down the pocket knife and gently tease apart the two sides of the incision I made. 

&amp;#x200B;

I. Am. **HORRIFIED.** Dozens of little maggots squirming around inside. I started gagging, until the realisation set in. 'I just stuck this thing inside of me. I may have maggots crawling around inside of my vagina right now.' The fact that they were maggots... doesn't that mean they had been there for a while? How long does it take fly eggs to hatch? In my state of panic, I snapped a quick photo (already knew that I was going to post that thing on 4chan), and rinsed out the entire thing with water, before cutting it into another 3 pieces and thoroughly rinsing them out with bleach and double wrapping them in a plastic bag and throwing it in the bin. I return to my room, disgusted, and make a [4chan post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/c6uwi5/femanon_embraces_her_inner_neckbeard/) I didn't know what to do after that, except wait for my family to wake up so I could have a shower without worrying about disturbing them. I have my shower and take a nap. That's the end.

**TL;DR** \- My home-made sex toy got infected with maggots without me realising, ended up fucking myself with it before I found out.

Background Info:

My (17M) GF (17F) have been dating for 7 months as of today. We're our first actual bf/gfs to each other. Since we couldn't do anything special for our 6 months due to a scheduling issue we decided to do something special today. That special thing was sex - losing our virginities to each other.

What happened?

Our parents are pretty strict. Her mom is sort of accepting of us as a couple, and her dad thinks that I'll turn her into a slut. She's Asian. My parents on the other hand don't know about the relationship at all because if I told them, they'd probably force me to break up cause dating ""isn't something that I should be doing at this age"". Up until this point today I have never been in my girlfriend's house because of how her dad is. Today both of her parents left for a trip in a city four hours away in the States (we live in a border town in Canada) and we thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to fuck while they were gone. Oh boy, we were very wrong.

Half an hour after her parents leave the house, I arrive and at first we just cuddled on the couch watching TV. Suffice it to say, it escalated from there, clothes were taken off, and a condom packet opened. I won't really get into the details cause it doesn't matter anyway. While on the couch, fucking we noticed a blue light shining across the room, turns out the in-home camera was activated (her family has one of those Xiaomi in-home camera systems that light up when someone is checking the feed). We stoped - knowing we were fucked. At this point we disconnect the camera thinking it was just auto recording or some shit, and tried to figure out how to wipe the video from the cloud using the Xiaomi app on her phone. Turns out, it wasn't recording, it was something way worse - her parents wanted to check on the house from her phone.

We put our clothes back on, and we both burst out crying. We know that her parents would do something bad. 20 minutes later her parents arrive (they turned away from thei journey) and a lot of yelling happened. Her mother seemed to be more understanding, and liked that I put on a condom, but her father literally chased me out of the house, threatened to get a restraining order on me, and grounded my girlfriend.

TL;DR: Decided to fuck gf in her house, we forgot about the live cameras, and her parents found out. We're fucked.

Edit: Spelling

Edit 2: HOLY SHIT THIS BLEW UP OVERNIGHT. I JUST WOKE UP TO ALL THESE UPVOTES/COMMENTS/MESSAGES AAA. THANKS FOR MY FIRST SILVER BTW

Edit 3: My first gold aaa. Ok I will start replying to stuff now

Edit 4: Thanks for my first platinum. I'm currently replying to the PMs, will reply to comments a bit later. And since many are asking, I'm Eastern European

Edit 5: I would prefer if people who messaged me didn't ask about weird shit like the details of the sex, pictures of me and her, video of me fucking her and that sort of thing

Edit 6: No, I won't call the cops on them or sue them. That would be a weak case. Technically they have the right to have those cameras and since they put them there not for the purpose of recording their daughter fucking her bf but for pets this would never fly in court. Pretty sure they're not getting off the recording/live stream. Most likely they saw the live stream for a second, and decided to turn back home. Furthermore, in Canada it's the crown (government) that sues for criminal offenses such as CP, and not the individual. This is a shit situation but you can't really go to court cause of this.",tifu,TIFU By Having Sex with My GF
lpgabriel,c6ffy8,"Obligatory this happened many years ago. 
Also, English is not my first language.

My girlfriend (now wife) and I had a long distance relationship for about 4 years until we started living together. During this period we only had a chance to see each other once every 6 months, when she would travel and stay at my place for a week or two. 
Being two horny teenagers, you can guess what we did in most of these days...

Unfortunately one of those days wasn't so good as the others.

I remember that day started with me waking up at 6am and late for work because of our previous night ""activities"". I was sleepy the whole day until I got home at night, only to find my gf in my bed ready for another round.

All I wanted was to sleep but I thought it was kinda rude to say no, so I lay behind her back like a spoon, put my arm over her and started giving her some finger love as I would always do during foreplay. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the lights were completely out.

As the minutes went by, I started dozing off intermittently, but I thought I could keep myself awake if I focused hard enough. 

Turns out I couldn't.

I don't remember actually falling asleep, but I do remember being awakened by my angry gf while she stormed off our bed and went to sleep on the couch downstairs.

I tried to explain myself and apologize but she wouldn't talk to me and just told me to leave her alone, so I just got back to my bed and slept like a rock.

The next day she apologized to me and said she got upset because I suddenly stopped what I was doing and started snoring behind her. That somehow made her think I didn't love her anymore, that's why she reacted that way.

After we both explained our sides of the story, we even laughed and all was good, but now we always ask each other if we're really ready before doing anything.

Justaprole,bzuk0p,"Obligatory: this happened like 3 months ago.

My gf, her mom, and I drove out to visit her uncle and were staying at his house for a few days. The night we arrive, my gf tells me that she's going to take a shower and goes down to the only bathroom in the house. After about 20 minutes, feeling a little mischievous, I sneak down and head to the bathroom so scare her in she shower. Quietly I enter and rip the shower curtains open. To my surprise its her mom.. she shouts ""what are you doing?! I shout ""I'm so sorry I though you were (gf)"" and I bolt out.

ObnoxiousFlounder,c0dq0j,"So this actually happened today. I was up early this morning and decided to go to my local 24hr discount supercenter. You know the one, the mart that has walls. Anyway I went to pick up a couple items and of course ended up getting more items then intended. On a whim I decided to get a box of condoms, I had read on reddit about this one brand that was pretty good and apparently the brand I had always used in the past were shit. I perused the health and beauty as well as the pharmacy area for about 30 minutes. I can never find shit in these stores and knew it was somewhere in one of these sections. Now I've been married for quite some time and we don't use condoms anymore, this was more for curiosity sakes. I'm not really shy but I knew I was going to have to ask someone where the condoms were and suddenly felt like a 16 year old boy. 

I had walked past a lady probably in her early to mid forties about a dozen times at this point and figured what the hell. So I walk over to her and apologize for having to ask, but where are the condoms located? She immediately responds with a bit of a lisp and points to her ears, she then says can you write it down? At this point I just wanted to walk away, but I knew this would appear rude so I reluctantly write down ""condoms?"". She goes ""ah"" smiles and starts walking down the aisle as if she knows exactly where they were. Relieved I follow along. She then stops, looks at me, and says ""for shaving?"" and makes a hand gesture for shaving your face. Again I'm ready to bail but she continues walking to another aisle to another associate. There were a couple other customers in the aisle with the employee. This woman decides to take her piece of cardboard with ""condoms?"" written on it and display it like a limo driver at an airport looking for passengers. I was mortified...everyone is looking at me. Thankfully associate #2 says oh they're right here and goes to the next aisle....they only had one brand and it wasn't the one I was looking for. Mission failed.

Frederick_the_medico,c7qcm6,"The good story starts as any good story does, with an Englishmen having his morning cup of tea. Though this time it doesn’t because the boss forgot to order more tea bags so no tea was to be had this morning. Enter me and bob, we love our morning tea so are rather annoyed ,so we plan to bring our own tea bags the next morning.

I see bob the next morning and walk up to him “Morning Bob, I’ve got the good shit this morning” I said gesturing toward my rucksack. He laughed and said “I’ve got to the good shit too”. Unknown to us a team Leader heard this and reported it to management.

Two hours later Bob and I are pulled into the office in front of the store manager. He’s a pretty cool guy, never given me any trouble as long as I do my job but he has to investigate this, so they also bring our rucksacks down.

M “So lads, I hear you’ve brought ‘the good shit to work’ with you?

Me “Yeah only because you guys haven’t got any here” Bob was chuckling.

M “This is really serious, you have a drugs allegation against you by a team Leader”

Me “Drugs, what are you on about? Tea. I’ve brought tea bags. There’s none in the staff room”.

So this went back and forth until they finally opened our bags and revealed a box of Tetley tea bags and a box of yorkshire tea bags. Safe to say the staff tea bags have been ordered.

TL;DR made it sound like me and a friend were bringing drugs into work but was actually just tea bags.

Po1sonator,c1up41,"So this happened 5 days ago when I told the kids the origin of the cycle and how to pull this off. I was with my wife at another couple’s house having dinner. Their 12 year old was there  with his friend. Somehow the conversation came up about farting and I asked if I had ever told them how I ruined my birthday party and almost my school life due to farting as a kid. They had not, so I assured them I would tell them the tale without letting them know how I did it.

As I tell you the tale below I won’t leave out the details of how I did it like I did for them.

There eyes and ears were on me as I told them of the 5th grade 25 years ago. I remember noticing that I was farting a lot. Not like just gassy, but powerful, chair vibrating farts. I was always inquisitive, so I wanted to find out what caused this. I remembered in the morning swallowing a ton of air to create a monster burp but it never came back up, not later or anytime. I guess it must have came out the other end.

To test this I swallowed tons of air the following day and every time it tried to come up I forced it to stay. Eventually I could feel it moving south through my body. About 20 minutes later it worked. I was blasting them but I still had some perfecting to do. At any rate I was farting so much that week that I was in trouble for disrupting class and they called my parents. I got my birthday party taken away! I was devastated but they said if I behaved I could have it back on the following Friday.

I just didn’t feel like I was fitting in anymore without farting so I decided to start the cycle up. After the first fart or two I was sent to the hall. I found myself sitting on the tile floor and had an idea for great fart reverb.

The system I had perfected went as follows:

\-To start the cycle swallow as much as air as you can, hold it and no matter what keep it in. If some slips out your mouth replace it.

\-After your first fart take 3 small gulps of air.

\-Continue after every fart until you want to be done.

\-Cool down period will take about 20-30 minutes to stop farting.

So anyway, I sat in that hallway, the Friday of my party and every time I wanted or needed to fart I held it in and swallowed more air. Until finally I was about to explode. I let out an unhuman machine gun fart that ripped the halls and made my teacher and another teacher from a different classroom come out. That was it for me. Parents called, birthday lost. One final chance for next week.

I was doing great I had stopped farting until One day my friend Shawn who I had taught the secret challenged me and I couldn’t back down. I even decided to bend over and blast one at one of the cafeteria workers. This was it, I lost the birthday forever. I was ready to run away but my friends talked me out of it. I was done for. I got an in school suspension for a day and stayed in the principals office. I had to write an essay on why farting like that was bad. I wish I still had it!

Through all of this my parents never knew there was a “cycle” Whenever my brother and I wanted to do it, since I had taught him, we would use code. “Hey brother, someday I hope to own a motor”cycle.” We would emphasize the cycle part. Well this just got us buried into even more trouble. I had even gotten so in tune with my body I could pick the style of fart, machine gun, squeakers, splat whoppers, I could choose any fart. I eventually had to bury the cycle for good. I only brought it out once in high school youth group to prove the story was true to them.

Anyway, I suppose that was a TIFU as well as a child, but lets now end the story at the dinner table.

These kids are begging me to tell them how to do this. I say I never will but the Mom tells me to go ahead…I don’t even know the other kid or his parents. I tell them and begin to coach them. My friend’s child actually pulls it off and is farting so loud all night. The other kid can’t get it.

Well yesterday I guess he goes to my church, I passed by him and he goes. “Hey I mastered it!!” I am just waiting for his parents to get a hold of me somehow when all of this comes out or even worse it spreads to their entire school because the friend's kid said he already taught everyone of his friends…

TLDR; mastered how to fart on command with max reverb and volume as a kid, told the story 25 years later to some middle schoolers and they ended up mastering it themselves which has me terrified of parents in this town.",tifu,"TIFU by teaching middle schoolers the art of ""The Cycle"" so now they know how to fart on command."
throwawayadhdsex,c4b7eh,"Unlike other TIFUs, this indeed happened today. Just a few minutes ago, actually. And yes, this is a throwaway for reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's Sunday afternoon, and it's a pretty lazy day here at my house. The husband indicates that he's in the mood for bedroom activities, and while I didn't particularly feel the need for carnal relations, I thought - what the hey, there's nothing better to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I put the two kiddos (10 and 12 yo girls) on the Netflix (She-Ra, because fuck yeah, girl power!), and we proceeded to the bedroom activity portion of this FU. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is the portion of my story where I realize that my FU may have actually been last night. Because last night is when I forgot to take my meds. It happens more often than it should, really. I'm a teacher, and it's summer time, and so forgetting to take my meds happens more often when I'm not on a regular schedule (and yes, I have a reminder in my phone, but sometimes I'm playing games and I turn off the alarm, thinking that I'll remember when I'm done with this level, but I never do...)

&amp;#x200B;

So anywhat, the husband starts his dirty finger dance on the honeypot, and I'm trying to get into it, but my mind is bouncing around like a Cirque d'Soylay trapeze dancer. Should my new Pathfinder be a human or half-elf? What about Trump and his assholeyness? I wonder how many pics we took in Bryce Canyon this week... We should really finish our moving plans soon. (You know, the stupid stuff your mind isn't supposed to think about while your clit is being dj'ed). 

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple of minutes, I finally just tell the hubs that he might as well just jump right on in and do what needs doing, because he might as well finish his deed since mine won't get done right now. So he obliges, but then starts taking his sweet time. I try to find a way to tell him, in not so many words, to just ""Wham bam, thank you ma'am"" and call it good, but the first words that come to mind pop out: 

&amp;#x200B;

""Bop it!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I instantly start giggling, then follow up with 

""Twist it."" 

""Flick it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

At first, the hubs tries to power through. But my giggles turned into hysterical laughing. I'm talking the kind where you're holding your stomach, sounding like a flock of Canadian goose migrating south for the winter.

Needless to say, his ability to ""Bop it"" deflates, and he's now in the shower, I'm assuming finishing the job himself with fewer distractions. I went and took my med, and hopefully I have better focus-ability to make it up to him later.

io3401,bz3tv2,"Maybe this is over dramatic, but I will forever feel horrible for this.

For some background, my kitten Bones is the runt of our latest litter, and is 10 weeks old. She’s really tiny, about half the size of her siblings. I say ‘mentally-challenged’ because she’s kind of stupid. By this I mean she walks into walls, off of edges, and into our other pets- and is completely stunned by this. She has to take a whole minute to figure out how to jump a short distance. At first we thought she was blind, but it turns out she’s just kind of slow I guess. When she wants attention or food she headbutts the wall. When she ‘runs’ she opens her mouth to breath and drools everywhere. She’s also somewhat cross-eyed, and also walks really weird, with her tail straight up, back legs bent like she’s crouching, and her ass half-way to the ground. We actually even named her Bones because when she walks, her hip bone juts out in a way that it’s very prominent. 
We took her to the vet last week, and he said she was perfectly healthy now besides breathing problems, but we should watch out for possible seizures in the future. He thinks she probably got dropped by her mom when she was a few days old, and that could be why she’s kind of weird.

So anyways, she’s my favorite little kitten out of the litter. Even though she’s quirky, she’s very loving and fun to play with. Her favorite thing to do is curl up against my neck and cuddle. 
Two days ago at 4 AM I had just finished binging GoT and went to go throw away the wrapper of a popsicle I’d eaten. She’s small enough to fit in my palm, so I got lazy and was carrying her and holding the popsicle wrapper in the same hand. This was a really stupid decision. 

I popped open the metal trash can and without even thinking, threw her and the wrapper in the trash. I didn’t even register it until I heard a loud thunk and strained ‘mrow’. It hit me and I rushed to turn the light on I could pull the top off and see inside. This happened to be the same night my mom decided to clear all the leftovers from the fridge into the trash can. So she was covered in a ton of old, sloppy food (mostly enchiladas and spaghetti). She also had somehow hit her face. She had a really bloody nose she kept sneezing from and I swear her head had a little bump that looked dark under the fur.

I panicked and took her to the bathroom to wipe her down. The second she heard the water she scratched the hell out of my hand and pissed and shit all over herself. I felt horrible. I got a washcloth and wiped her down the best I could, but she wasn’t happy at all and her bloody nose kept going. 
It eventually stopped but I still felt like shit. She didn’t trust me for the rest of the night or the next day, and kept running away from me. She didn’t eat at all and only laid in the same place. I was so scared I had given her severe brain damage or something crazy. She warmed up to me again, but I will forever feel horrible.

Also the scratches she gave me got infected and pus-filled, so there’s that. I deserve it. 

Tl;dr: Was too lazy to hold my runty and mentally challenged kitten and trash in different hands, so I accidentally threw her into a metal trash can so hard I gave her a horrible bloody nose and bump. Also got infected scratches from trying to help her, which I more than deserve.

EDIT: Bones is okay!! She’s still being her derpy self, walking off beds and into walls. Nothing is broken and she isn’t in any pain! She’s eating and running just like before :)
(Also fixed the post because my sister reminded me that she’s 10 weeks, not 8)

EDIT 2: Since so many of you asked, here she is!
https://imgur.com/gallery/9vy8T36

EDIT 3: I have decided I’m going to make up for this horrendous sin by dedicating the rest of my life to making sure she’s healthy, happy, and loved.

EDIT 4: I’m really sorry for flooding this posts with edits, but I’d like to keep you all informed. The commenters telling me I should get her checked anyways are right. Next week when Bones goes to get shots, I will have the vet check her out and I’m also going to ask about the chance of her still being potentially blind (many of you pointed out her unfocused eyes) and Cerebullar Hypoplasio (which her mama also has!). Because a week is a long time to be in potential pain, I’m having my mom’s friend (another vet) come over tomorrow to check her out and hopefully give me the brands of potential painkillers she can safely take as a baby. 
Thank you all for the advice and support! ❤️

EDIT 5: I’ve already gotten a dozen or so comments asking that I fix her mama because she shouldn’t be breeding if she has a neurological disorder. And I completely agree! 
But the problem here is that Bones’ mama isn’t my cat. She’s my sister’s cat, and my sister is refusing to fix her. She actually was going to, but then we found out she was pregnant with Bones’ litter, and spaying a preggo cat = murder in my sister’s eyes, I guess. 
I fully plan on spaying Bones ASAP! I disagree with breeding and if I could fix my sister’s cat, I would.

Chasicle,c59d4x,"I like to eat in bed.  Little did I know it would almost kill me. This fine evening I decided to make myself a few sandwiches and sit in bed while browsing the internet. After finishing my sandwiches I put my ceramic plate on my nightstand next to the bed.  Brushed my teeth and went to sleep. 

Next morning I’m pretty horny and roll over and initiate with my wife. We do the deed and end up mostly on my side of the bed. After I finished I roll off her and intend to roll to the side of the bed with my butt on the edge and feet hanging off so I’m basically sitting on the edge of the bed. Well, I misjudged it and fell right off the bed. In the process of falling I knocked off the plate and proceeded to land directly on top it. Naturally it shatters. I felt no pain so my first thought was “damn, that was close.” My wife asks if I’m ok so I look down and see a large gash on my right knee cap, which for some reason wasn’t bleeding, a profusely bleeding puncture in my thigh next to my knee, and on my left foot, two more punctures that were mildly bleeding. 

Shit. Is this how it’s going to end, bleeding out on my bedroom floor while butt naked?  I tell my wife no, I’m not ok and urgently tell her to drive me to the ER.  She doesn’t realize how badly I’m bleeding since I’m putting pressure on my leg with a towel I found nearby, and proceeds to slowly get the kids ready and in the car before helping me put on some shorts, a shirt, and helps me down the stairs and into the car. 

We get to the ER and by that time I’ve miraculously stopped heavily bleeding. I find a wheelchair and wheel myself to the front desk to check in. Since I’m not noticeably bleeding anymore they didn’t give me priority. Eventually I check in and they ask what happened. I tell them exactly what happened except I left out the sex part. They legitimately did not believe me and asked if my wife did it. My wife then happened to walk in with the kids after parking the car so I motioned to her and told the receptionist “no, this is kind of embarrassing, but we had just had sex and I rolled off the bed, etc.”  

At this point a few other ER personnel overheard and started cracking up. The receptionist loudly asked my wife across the room “if it was true.” My wife embarrassingly nodded her head.

I get admitted and they remove the plate shards, stitch me up, and tell me to practice safe sex in the future since I literally could have died had the plate hit my artery.

ThrowAwayMoldyPotato,c6ah3x,"About 8 years ago, just before I went to University, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me.  Reasons included, but were not limited to:

-My weight

-My appearance

-Distance at different universities, 

blah blah blah, but very importantly, and I quote

""You've got the most annoying voice on the face of the planet""

Being my first girlfriend, I was heartbroken. In a good way. I decided to improve myself at University, the whole glowup procedure. I was going to a different University from all my other friends anyways, might as well start new.

I started working out, eating healthy, started doing more skin care. Ended up losing 60 pounds and getting a six pack.

I started looking up how to dress better. Out with baggy tshirts that hide my moobs, in with the fitted jeans and collared shirts. Got contacts, started learning how to style my hair. 

Took self-improvement classes, got some therapy, started being happier with myself. Started calling myself with my middle name instead.

And very very important... I started practicing an Australian accent. Stupid me thought hey, let's try and learn the sexiest accent out there.

By no means do I LOOK Australian. Heck I'm 3rd generation Chinese-Canadian.

But I got GOOD. I studied it religiously. Hours of practice. It got to the point even Australian Natives couldn't tell the difference. Problem was, I couldn't turn it off. Meh, s'okay, it's a good accent.

So now I LOOK completely different, SOUND different, and even go by a different name. Top it off with me moving to another province for work.

Now we start the FU.

Fast-forward to about 1 month ago when I started a new job. Boss is doing the rounds, introducing me to the team. He then introduces me to my cubicle mate/work buddy for orientation.

It's my ex.

And I start sweating bullets. This girl is triggering a massive flight response. I am TERRIFIED of her. I am ready to quit right there and then.

And she doesnt recognize me. At. All.

I obviously can't ignore her, so I try to play it chill. She starts asking me some generic get to know you questions.

""Where are you from? I love your accent! ""Where did you go to school?"" Etc. Etc. Etc.

I panic. And I lie. A lot.

""I grew up in Brisbane."" (Nope. Kamloops)
""Did my MBA at UofT"" (UBC)
""Oh yeah, totally miss Australia"" (I went there once... During a layover)

And it keeps going. Can't be that bad right? Just one person that thinks I'm someone else.

And then we have a team ice breaker.
""Introduce what you know about your buddy to the rest of the team."" Of course, my ex then introduces me with what I just told her...

And now, the entire team thinks I'm their resident Australian, and I'm now living a complete lie.

On the plus side, the ex asked me out for dinner?

TL;DR: Improved myself to the point I look like a different person, lied in my introduction to my ex, now I'm living a lie, and I'm now an Australian.",tifu,TIFU by improving myself after a breakup
puffzadddy,c0m5yl,"Ok so like most of these posts this didn't happen today. This actually happened quite a while ago when I was 17. There's a TLDR at the bottom too because this is gonna be pretty long. So one night, I was in the mood to masturbate because what else do teenagers do. However, I decided that jerking off in the traditional way was too boring. It's to basic. No, I had to get creative with it. So I sat down and started brainstorming and after some time I had a genius idea. I was gonna MacGyver a giant fleshlight.

In my mind, this idea was way too good to pass up, so I began construction immediately. I took two pillows off of my bed,  put them on top of one another on the floor. I knew that I wasn't going to be able to use this like a regular fleshlight because if I held the pillows and fucked them that way there wouldn't be any pressure on my dick. Removing the entire point of this thing. **Pleasure**. 

When I put the pillows on the floor, I was trying to slide my dick into the space where the two pillows met. I noticed two things here. Firstly, the pillows cases on these pillows were too rough and secondly fucking the pillows on the floor placed them directly under me and when I thrusted my peehole would open because I have a parabola dick and that hurt like a bitch because my mushroom tip rubbed against the top pillow. To solve that problem, I figured that moving the pillows up to dick level would fix the issue because that way I could just slide it in. Sure my peehole might still open but at least I'd be able to work around it that way. So, I put my laundry basket underneath the pillows and that solved the problem. Now I could fuck the pillows doggystyle. To solve the second problem I put a dashiki that my mom gave me as a gift in between the pillows and opened the bottom of the shirt and wrapped it around the opening. That way when I slid in my dick would be inside the shirt. This solved that problem because the dashiki was made of silk.

This thing was coming along nicely. If I slid into it and used my thumbs to press down on the pillows so that they would wrap around my peter it actually felt pretty good. However, I didn't want to press my thumbs down on it so I wrapped a belt around the entry space. Btw this turned out to be useless because I still had to press down. 

I feel like my description of this might be oyster shit so recreated the thing with some different materials. The link for that will be under the TL;DR.

My creation was complete. Now it was doggy time. I really wanted to make love to these pillows so I took all my clothes off so it could feel more intimate. Here's where I fucked up. Normally, I would lock the door when I was doing weird shit like this, but in this case I figured that I was gonna be quick so I didn't do it.

I found some porn, placed the laptop next to my bed so that it would be at eye level, got down on my knees, and started fucking.

I was really getting into this thing like I was sweating and shit. I immediately regretted everything when my door burst open. Turns out my mom was doing laundry downstairs, and she decided to be kind and bring my clothes upstairs so that I could put them away. This is the first time she'd EVER done this. And needless to say she never did it again. My mom opened the door to see her naked son fucking pillows from his bed while a video of Mei from Overwatch getting plowed by Coach from Left For Dead played on his laptop. She tossed me my clothes and promptly closed the door. 

I sat there on my floor naked, and just fucking hating myself. I regretted everything that led to that moment. When she finally did confront me about what she saw she only talked about the porn. She said something along the lines of, ""When did you start watching porn?"" And I said some dumb shit like ""well you know boys will be boys hurhurhur."" Since then she hasn't said anything about it, but I KNOW this will pop up again because that's just how she is. At the time, this was mortifying but I find it pretty funny these days.

Oh and btw even after she walked in I still finished. Too much work went into that to not finish in it. I had to throw that dashiki away.

**TL;DR:** I MacGyvered a giant fleshlight using pillows and my mom caught me fucking it. She hasn't said anything about it since but I'm certain that she'll bring it up again.

EDIT: So in the beginning of this post I said that this happened quite a while ago and when I was 17. Some people may be confused by the ""quite a while ago"" part. That's just poor wording on my part. I'm a 2000s baby. Overwatch came out in 2016. I'm 19 now. I'll let y'all do the math on that.",tifu,TIFU by having sex with my pillows
ditto_ditto__,c4yizi,"So, for starters, this is my favorite story. It happened last summer but I want to share it and we still have never talked about this.

I had just gotten out of a four year relationship a few months before and was finally feeling ready to meet people again. One of my friends asked if I had met “Clara” and I said nope. He told me she would be at a party this weekend that everyone was going to and I needed to come! So, I look her up and am excited. He thinks we would be a good fit so I’m sort of planning on at least chatting her up.

Well, my best friend “Klonster” and I are hanging before the party and I ask him if he knows Clara. He says he does and talks her up like crazy. I am now totally excited. We meet up at this large park in my city and are drinking beers, throwing a frisbee, playing some music, etc. Well, I find myself chatting to someone next to her and I just lean over with my hand out and introduce myself. Twenty minutes later we are still talking, and that’s when Klonster comes over and sits right next to her and leans his head on her shoulder. I realize he was talking her up because he likes her! Well, he’s my best friend so I think we both just sort of decide to see how the night goes by, and sorry but yes, making it a competition. Nothing serious, just seemed funny and assumed we would both “lose”. Well, a bit later a handful of us decide to hit up our favorite dive bar. Klonster and Clara included. A few more drinks in and we are both surely being so obvious and obnoxious but yes still both chatting her up for a bit.

We decide to go to my place and just my two roommates (a couple) and Klonster and Clara come back. We walk in and Klonster chooses a movie and turns it on. I use the restroom and return to see her cuddled into his chest. I figure that’s it. Game, set, match. And enjoy the movie for a bit. I get tired around 2am and say those two can sleep in my bed if that want to or they can sleep on the couch. They opt for my bed.

Clara is in the middle and we all start falling asleep when she says “I’m not tired. Should we play truth or dare?”. We both say yep and proceed to do silly dares. Eventually involving waking up my roommates and having them come into my room to play. Doesn’t take long before the boyfriend says he’s so tired and that all five of us should go into their bed and fall asleep to a scary movie.

The bed goes as follows, from right side of bed to left: BF, GF, me, Clara, Klonster. So, it’s squished in this Full size bed and Clara is having to put some of herself on me. I’m not thinking anything of it because we are going to sleep. Due to the cramped situation, I have to really contort my body and arms to be comfy. So, I’m turned toward the GF with my right hand going backwards towards Clara. Well, before I fall asleep she grabs my hand...

Suddenly, I’m all like, “no way. I’m making out tonight!” And I’m super stoked. And 32. Anyway, it’s just fun, ya know? So, she starts playing with my hand and I’m sort of rubbing her’s right back. And then it’s borderline violent. My hand is being fucked by her hand. So, I return it her way with plenty of strength as well. And I notice she’s got some rough hands. I know she is an artist of sorts so it’s almost hot. At this point, I’m thinking, okay where do I go from here?

Her head is in my chest area and I just lean down for some weird reason and kiss her forehead. Seemed normal at the time. Well, a moment later she stands up and says she’s going to sleep on the couch. I realize I’m still holding hands with someone. I look over and Klonster and I make eye contact while holding hands. I turn away in the bed, he just stands up and leaves the house. No words exchanged.

I am laughing so hard to myself about how this girl I just met tonight must be so confused that I kissed her forehead. Oh, then realize she has rough hands because they were actually my best friend’s hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Update! I can’t believe this blew up so much but happy to see this gave so many of you a laugh. I still live with the GF and checked with her and apparently I am not good at determining bed sizes either, it’s a queen. No mol was going on, we are just a funny group of friends at times so the couple inviting us to sleep in their room didn’t seem strange in the slightest. Klonster and I are still best friends, but he is someone who would have a hard time talking about this but I find it hilarious. Anyone else, I would’ve laughed with them there and then.

wyattkelly,bys0rm,"So a little bit of backstory is required for this post.  It's sad, but it has to be done.

Last year, my father passed away due to complications related to his exposure to Agent Orange. He had been a military man most of his adult life, and served with distinction during his year in Vietnam.  Three bronze stars are not an easy thing to come by.  Unfortunately, during that time the area around his deployment was heavily defoliated by Agent Orange, so he was basically marinated in the stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

It was difficult watching this vibrant, intelligent, loving man deteriorate into constant pain, suffering from chronic bursitis, diabetes, emphysema, his mind going inch by fragile inch. The last five years had been hell for him, and for my mom.  Still, he did his best to stay as busy as he could, volunteering with local charities and taking on as much responsibility as he could.  He even adopted a little chihuahua from the local pound, a sausage of a dog that he named Missy.  She loved him more than anything, and kept him active by playing, forcing him on walks, or just snoozing in his lap while he watched TV.  

&amp;#x200B;

He had surgery for a spinal stimulator on a Monday, and was sent home to rest.  The pain was absolutely unbearable for him, and he could barely sit.  From what Mom told me, he didn't sleep nearly at all in the last few days of his life, and he even had to have  a catheter inserted due to the pain pills he was on. Apparently, the pills can sometimes cause a person's bladder to shut down.  Thursday afternoon, he was heading to the doctor to have the catheter removed, when he stumbled down the front steps of his house, hit his head, and that was really it. That big beautiful caring heart couldn't take  anymore.  And Missy, his loving chihuahua watched it all from the front window, barking as the ambulance came and took him away.  That night, and for any nights after, she stood by the front door or curled up in his favorite chair, just crying and whining.

&amp;#x200B;

I've moved back in with my Mom to help her take care of the house. It's a big old country-style house, with a huge yard that she couldn't handle on her own.  When I lived a few towns away, I'd come over once a week and mow, but now I can do all the yard work, fix the toilets, the ceilings, etc.  I'm single, so it's not been a great trouble, and she likes having someone around. Plus Missy has adopted me, and does all the stuff she did with Dad.  It's a great arrangement.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's been a little over a year since Dad passed away, and Mom was out of town visiting my sister and some cousins, and I have the weekend off.  I didn't feel like visiting friends, or having them come over here, so just been puttering around the computer, watching videos, playing a game or two, etc.  Missy was asleep on the floor behind me in her dog bed, only getting up when she wanted loving or to beg me for a treat.  I was thinking about Dad, and was thinking how ephemeral life truly is, how many will never hear the voices of loved ones again.  Then I remembered that I'd recorded Dad for a podcast a friend of mine and I used to do, interviewing him for the work he'd done in Folklore over his life.  He was a storyteller as a hobby, and had gone all over Ohio to tell the ghost stories he'd collected over the years.  

&amp;#x200B;

So without thinking of anything besides just wanting to hear my Dad's voice again, I loaded up the podcast and started listening.  Next thing I know I nearly got bowled out of my chair by a very ecstatic chihuahua. She was leaping onto my lap, yapping and bouncing as she tried to get to the computer speakers. Daddy was in there! RIGHT THERE!  And of \*COURSE\* that's when in the recording past Missy came trotting in, and my Dad said, ""Hi Missy!""

&amp;#x200B;

I still feel horrible.  I hadn't even thought about how this might affect her.  She's spent the rest of the day at the front window, staring out, ears perked, waiting for her Daddy who will never come home.

TLDR; I played a recording of my deceased Dad's voice, and his dog heard it and is now waiting for him to come home.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. I'm sorry if i made some of your cry.  Anyway, as requested, here's the podcast:

ItsSatineActually,c2knkv,"So naturally this didn’t actually happen today, and this isn’t my story, but my coworker has given me permission to share her story in first-person as she doesn’t use reddit but this is an amazing fuckup. Here it goes.

My husband and our two kids (two boys aged 4 and 6) were on our way back from an amusement park nearby. We literally were there from open to almost close (10 A.M. to 8 P.M.), and of course, we had taken the interstate to get home as fast as possible. This is where our fuckup began. 

What we had forgotten about, somehow, was that on this stretch of interstate close to our house, they are currently trying to extend two lanes into three. The traffic, even at this time of night, is almost at a dead stop because of construction. This was when I realized that I shouldn’t have drank four souvenir cups of soda without using the restroom... at the amusement park.

So now, we are in traffic, and it’s at a dead stop. I turn to my husband and tell him I have to pee; to which he replies that we can’t stop because the shoulders are closed during construction. I started to panic; realizing I was going to piss my pants. That is, until, I realized my kids had empty McDonald’s cup.

I reach back and grab one, and at this point the traffic had cleared, but we still are 20 minutes away from home, and we live in a rural area, so there’s no where to stop, and the construction goes all the way up to our exit. I finally make the decision to piss in the cup, to my husband’s horror. 

I took the top off of the cup, and dumped the rest of the soda out of the window. The wind whipped it against the car, but didn’t hit me or the kids. If it had, we may not be here today.

I wiggles out of my shorts and got the cup down there, sliding over the edge of my seat so that I could piss. I relieved myself at an awkward angle; until I realized... Shit. I’m going to overflow the cup.

Before I did so, panicking, I lifted the cup up, prepared to poor that out the window too. This was my fuck up. My awful fuck up. You see, I thought the piss would go out just like the soda. I didn’t, however, realize that now my hand was at a different angle, and we were going much, much faster than before. 

I felt the piss mist immediately hit me in my face. My husband automatically started groaning, and my kids immediately started screaming. My oldest asked, ‘Mommy, what was that?!’ And all I could do was look at him and say ‘Buddy, I am so sorry’. Still, I had to piss. I went for round two with the cup as my husband laughed and cried, and my youngest started bawling. He actually got the brunt of it because he was right behind my chair. 

This time I wasn’t going to throw it out the window, but my husband told me to do it because it might spill in the car and make everything worse. He told me to throw it out in the BACK of the window this time.

I did it again. Everyone got a second golden shower. My oldest thinks it’s hilarious and the youngest doesn’t remember. I know I am disgusting and I have learned my lesson.

TL;DR I drank too much soda at an amusement park, pissed in a cup in the car, tried to toss piss out the window, sprayed my whole family.

ElonMuskPaddleBoard,byzwc1,"So this happened today and I’m super embarrassed by it but here goes.

So about two weeks ago I got an awesome tattoo on my lower arm. Now I work in a professional office, so I wear a suit every day, so none of my coworkers know about any of my tattoos, much less this one. 

This is my first time getting a tattoo and having to wear a suit every day, so it presented some challenges. Most notably - the itch. From day 4-14 it’s pretty itchy, and it’s uncomfortable in a suit. No problem though, that’s what lotion is for. 

So I brought in a bottle of lotion to work so I could lotion up during the day, and when it gets bad, I would just run to the bathroom, wash my hands, jump in a stall, lotion up, let it air dry a minute and go back to work. However, it’s a busy week, so in most cases I had to wait until I needed to go to hop in. Not a big deal, so I thought....

**what my coworkers saw:** me looking uncomfortable and wound up during the day, then grabbing a bottle of lotion and heading into the bathroom, then coming out all cool and relieved. Yup, they thought I was going in to do *that* deed. 

The funny thing, it was only a small group and no one said anything until at lunch today, when we were making small talk. I mentioned that I had gotten a tattoo and was finally mostly healed, only a few more days of lotion and I’m good. I saw them all have the “ohhhhhhhhh” moment at the same time. “That makes a lot more sense ElonMuskPaddleBoard!” They all thought I was having some weird issues and needed to relieve myself mid day.

Potat0heads,c06stv,"This happened late 2018 whilst on holiday in Tenerife..

Me and my girlfriend had been out partying at some bars/clubs for our last night before having to fly home the next day. We had drank a lot but decided to leave before we got to the black out stage

As we started walking back to the apartment my girlfriend was complaining that her new heels were hurting her feet, so me being the kind gentleman I am I kindly offered her to climb onto my back so I could carry her.

We hadn't walked very far and she kept falling down so my genius drunk brain thought it would be a good idea to lean over on the count to 3 whilst she climbs up...

Not a good idea. Very bad.

We both went down and having both our weight I landed face first and busted my lip and eye, luckily all my teeth were still all in place and my girlfriend had only hurt her knee. 

This happened right in front of two taxi drivers and they didnt even laugh or offer to help. They're probably used to seeing drunk tourists doing stupid shit.

After getting up and realizing we were both in a bad mess and that it was gonna be a long walk home some kind stranger walked past and kind of realised what had happened and gave us €5 to get a taxi back.

The next day I had to travel to the airport hungover and with a busted face (balloon lip). I cant imagine what people were thinking when they looked at me

I might be able to attach a photo for proof of my face  if this gets any attention.

Probs-disowned,c03x8w,"Throw away account. I just can’t rn.

Some background info: 

So I’m a dude, gay and all and I’m in a secret relationship with my boyfriend, of 2 years. We pretend to be just the best of friends, not holding each others hands, cuddling etc. unless we’re in a guaranteed secure and private space, like in a bedroom.

I live with a religious family, and they’re pretty homophobic except for my big sister. She’s pretty supportive.

So here we are, June 12 Wednesday; I decided to invite my BF over as usual. It’s not strange for him to come home with me. He had a pretty good friendship with my mom and dad too. HAD. So there we were, we just finished eating dinner while we laughed on the table, you know, the norms. I kiss my mom and dad good night, my BF drops a good night to them as well and they enter their bedroom, while we enter mine. I live in a one floor house, but it’s pretty long, with my parents at the end of the hall, so I pretty much had a lot of privacy in the night. So we began doing the usual, cuddling on the floor where he’s mattress is, kissing each other, until things became spicy. I’m not gonna explain anymore, since I don’t wanna be a guy from r/ihavesex. Anyway, it leads to him sitting on the bed and me sucking him off. That’s where it all went wrong. I forgot I asked my dad to fix my broken shoes for PE tomorrow, and he’s one to sneak into my bedroom to drop stuff in. I usually know when he would come, even had one close call, but I was just into the moment that I couldn’t focus on my environment. So there, I hear the door open, some light comes in, and next thing you know he began shouting and kicked my BF out in nothing more but his pants. It was a long night of shouting, a night of me and my mom crying, and here I am just laying in bed, planning to maybe sneak out to school while my parents quarrel in the bedroom.

tl;dr Invited my BF home, got caught sucking dick by my religious dad.

MorallyApplicable,c6f89l,"Nowhere near as sexual or disturbing as most of the popular TIFU's on here, but,

My boyfriend's birthday was two weeks ago. For his birthday, back in April, I bought him concert tickets to his favorite band that I also really like. As we're young (I'm 15F, he's 16M), my dad was the one who purchased them, put them in his calendar, and he purchased one for himself as well to chaperone. The concert was at an arena about an hour away.

Well, this was back in April. We've had these concert tickets printed out since then, for yesterday, The 26th of June. For his actual birthday I also printed out a copy of the third ticket and gave it to him, he's had that since and his parents have looked at it. Yesterday we picked my BF up, drove an hour out to the arena to find an empty lot. We were a bit early, its a popular band and we wanted to beat the rush. My dad was thrilled, until he checked the tickets and took a closer look.

Thursday, the 26th, it reads. I tell my dad these tickets cant be right, todays Wednesday. It must've been a glitch. My dad tells me to read it again, and hes struggling to contain his laughter.

Thursday, the 26th, September 2019. My dad loses it and so does my boyfriend. We're three months off and have successfully wasted upwards of two hours of our time. Six people have handled these tickets for three months, and no one has ever noticed it says September. I'd like to say I'm an intelligent person, but I no longer can. My dad made 100 jokes about us having to stay together. All ended well, we went to Dairy Queen and got ice cream as consolation.

IGotYouThisBox,c3rjm0,"Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago.


I was watching John Mulaney’s Netflix special where he talks about his first prostate exam, and it absolutely killed me. I’m talking tears out of my eyes, six-pack inducing laughter.
Fast forward the next day and I was getting a regular physical checkup and unexpectedly had to get a prostate exam. I bent over and let the doctor do their thing and tried to think of things to take my mind off it. Now of course my dumbass starts thinking about the John Mulaney skit. That’s when it happens.

I couldn’t help myself. Mid-prostate exam, with my doctor’s finger 2 knuckles deep in me, I let out a low, sustained “hmmmmhmhmm” with a huge grin on my face.

I instantly realized what happened. He pulled out, we made the most uncomfortable prolonged eye contact of my life, and then I pulled up my pants and hauled ass out of there.

I think I need to find a new doctor...

LighthouseInSnow,c56v5e,"My 8 year-old came home this Sunday afternoon with a soda can he got as a gift. He was bragging about it to his little sister who immediately took the bait and started whining about not having any soda – despite hating the taste of soda and never drinking it.

Things were escalating quickly and we were in a hurry to go see Toy Story 4, so to spare me the impending fighting and negotiations I suggested we pour the soda into their water bottles so they could share it. Knowing my daughter wouldn’t drink it, I just put one drop into hers and filled it up with watered down juice, and then the rest into my son’s. My son was in on the deception. Yay, everyone was happy and we managed to get to the movie theatre in time.
The theater was packed but we find our seats and they have their bottles plus a bag of popcorn each.
My daughter drinks her “soda”, happily giving it thumbs up but my son is so captured with the movie he forgets about his.

About thirty minutes in he finally gets thirsty and grabs his bottle. This particular brand has a straw going down the bottle and a button at the top so that when you push the button the spout pops up and you drink. Boy, did I not think through the physics of that, despite actually being, you know A PHYSICIST.
My son pushes the button, up flies the spout and immediately a rocket stream of soda shoots through like a friggin’ space shuttle hurtling into the air. The golden stream reaches at least 6 feet straight up, spraying everyone below on the descent.

My son desperately tries to close the spout but the pressure is too strong and the asshole bottle just keeps shooting the stream like an animated lightsaber.
People in the crowd around were either panicked, angry or laughing and when I realized what was happening I jumped over to my son grabbed the bottle, wrestled the spout down and managed to secure the missile.

When I look up I see the mortified face of my son who just sits there frozen still and absolutely soaking wet. Seeing the drops trickling from his hair, over his face and down his chin I just lose it. I laugh so hard that I begin to cry, and I should get some sort of parenting award because he does NOT find any of this amusing, but the angrier he looks the funnier it is to me.
 
When I realize this is about to turn into an incident that will scar him for life I get a grip, rip off my shirt and start to pat him down. Then I scrub the leather seats, armrests etc. and make sure no one in the crowd is furious with us or in need of a tissue.
Everything is sticky for the rest of the film and my son keeps his head down sunken into his seat.
Occasionally I burst out cackling like a hyena reliving the whole thing and every time my son shoots me a killer look but I try to accredit it to a joke in the movie. He wasn’t buying it.
 
After we get out of the theater he makes me swear to NEVER tell ANYONE and so instead of calling my friends I’m just telling Reddit.
 
TL;DR I put soda in my son’s water bottle and thanks to physics he ended up spraying it all over a movie theater but mostly himself

DifferentSetOfJaws,bz6fan,"I’m a kindergarten teacher with a class of 18 hellions who give me a run for my money every day. Almost 2 weeks ago a fight broke out among a couple kids over some dumb thing or another while we were walking back inside the building after recess so I had to deal with that but could also hear suspicious giggling coming from the back of the line. We finally made it back into the classroom, the kids scattered and started screaming, and the next thing I know there were about a dozen ladybugs crawling all over the rug. These ding dongs had them trapped in their sweaty, grubby hands for who knows how long, and I was just thankful none of them had died. I immediately poked a Ziploc bag full of holes with a thumbtack and dumped them in vowing to put them back outside after school. I ended up completely forgetting about them until today during my end of the year classroom clean out. The bag had gotten buried under a stack of papers on top of the cubby where I’d left them and all the ladybugs were dead except for one which was miraculously still alive! Except that I realized the others had bits missing and others were reduced to what I can only describe as crumbs. I let the surviving ladybug out of the bag and it walked around my hand for a few seconds before flying off in a frenzy, which I have never seen a ladybug do before. I can only imagine what was going through its mind after suddenly being released after 2 weeks of pure misery.

Usually I am very shy and I try very hard to avoid even the Possibility of an awkward situation. For example I don't even hug my closest friend simply because she has a boyfriend henceforth there could be a misunderstanding.

Anyways, I met this girl today, she was really nice, we talked a lot and i really liked the way she thinks. We took the same tram on the way back home, but had to get out earlier than she did. 

There we talked a lot about appearances, and how they could be misleading, when I mentioned that I think she looks like a nice girl, the kind that keeps out of mischief. Then she answered that this is only the scraping-the-surface-impression, stating that she is even tattooed. 

Right there I realised that i had to get out quick, in order not to walk back from the next station.
As i didn't want to be rude i told her quickly that I'd like to see that at some point, but i had to get out now and then left. 
That's when i realised that she told me that her tattoo was on her boobs.

Update:

As a lot of prople encouraged me to write her, i finally brought myself to contact her.

I proposed a bicycle trip trough the nearby forest because she mentioned she likes cycling and is new in town so I think I'll be able to show her some new nice things she likes.

CuteCuteJames,c45e2y,"My boyfriend and I adopted a stray cat from a shelter about six months ago. He has some emotional problems, likely from a previously abusive living situation.

I have a very set routine on workday mornings. Alarm goes off, I get up, I shower, I come out, I hug and snuggle our cat in between getting dressed. At any other point of the day, he is much calmer about attention, but in the morning, it's cuddle time.

Two days ago, my alarm went off, and little Vladimir just looked at my phone blearily. I told him to go back to sleep and I would see him in a few minutes.

I get out of the shower, and he is still so sleepy. He just looks at me with half-closed eyes all curled up and comfy.

I figure the poor thing needs more sleep, so I get dressed and leave quietly with just an ""I love you!"" as I walk out the door.

Upon my return home that evening, my boyfriend, who has been home with our little boy, spins this tale of woe of a small cat who was cranky, moody, and sad the WHOLE DAY. Vladimir thought I was rejecting him because I didn't give him the cuddles n' snuggles in the morning like I always do.

I gave him big hugs that night and apologized and told him how much I love him and how glad I am that he is ours.

I vowed never to let another morning pass without a full amount of love for this sweet little kitty.

nothintooseahear,bykjm0,"This happened about a decade ago, and I'm finally comfortable sharing this anonymously to the public.

TL;DR I was tasked with researching a subject for my government job, and asked some questions online that led to me being investigated and eventually interrogated as a potential terrorist by the FBI and NCIS.

After I graduated from college, I used to work for the Navy as an engineer and direct federal employee. During my time there I mostly worked on small budget experimental and prototype projects. At one point, our team discussed placing our prototype on an RC airplane for testing purposes because they were a low cost alternative to our other testing methods. You know, try to save the government money. No one on my team had much experience with RC planes, but I had a little experience with multirotors from a college senior project. I gladly volunteered to research the subject as it sounded interesting.

Initially, I used google to find some RC planes what would meet our requirements. Unfortunately, most RC planes at the time were sold as a frame, and required you to choose an engine, propeller, batteries and other components that affect the capabilities of the airplane. The best place to find information about these planes was on online forums. Each model of airplane often had its own thread with hobbyist discussing the various configurations and performance characteristics of the plane.  

I found a particular RC airplane that I thought would meet my team's needs. I hopped on the forum and innocently asked how much weight the plane could carrying and how fast it could go. At first, I received some genuine responses until someone said, ""Wait a minute, why are you asking?!""  I panicked. I baked up some excuse of why I couldn't respond because I was under an NDA (technically true). Several forum members accused me of ruining the hobby and the thread devolved into personal attacks. I privately messaged two of the most vocal users who were certain I was a terrorist to let them know I worked for the Navy, and wasn't a terrorist. One user believed me; one called me a liar. I ultimately decided it was time to cut my losses and deleted my account from the forum. We ended up not using RC planes at the time and I thought that was that. I put it out of my mind.

About 4 months later, I received a call at 4:30pm from someone I will refer to as Special Agent Smith with NCIS. On the phone, Special Agent Smith asked if I could come visit him at his office right then. My job, at the time, was legally required to be a 9-5. My pregnant wife was expecting me home at about 5:15pm. So I asked Special Agent Smith how long it would be and what the nature of the visit was. He responded with, ""Only about half an hour"" and ""I'll tell you when you get here.""

I sent my wife a quick text that I'd be a little late getting home, and headed over to the NCIS office. I left my cell phone at the front desk and joined Special Agent Smith at his desk where he started taking notes on his laptop. The conversation was very casual at first, with the agent making remarks like, ""Just have to get some information down. I'm sure you type much faster than me,"" as clicked away at his keyboard filling in a bunch of information into some form.

The questions started simple, like, ""What are your hobbies?"" and ""How are you liking your job?"" The conversation continued casually with general get to know you questions for the next half an hour to hour.  I remember the exact moment when the interview changed to an interrogation. After a short pause, Special Agent Smith changed his tone and asked me why I hadn't mentioned RC planes as a hobby and simultaneously showed me a picture of me with my senior project team that had been pulled off of some archived university server. I was also shown printed out conversations from the RC forum where the conversations had occurred about the RC airplanes. The questions quickly changed to, ""How do I feel about the president?"" ""How do I feel about the war?"" The tone was no longer casual, and the questions became very pointed.

The pointed questions continued for another 30 minutes. Special Agent Smith encouraged me to be completely honest because it would be better for me if I just told him everything. After the questioning was complete, and just as fast as the interrogation had become aggressive, Special Agent Smith relaxed and told me, ""I already talked to your bosses, so I knew you weren't a terrorist. But, I had to go through the process anyway."" I was also informed that from the original forum post about the airplane, someone had reported my username as a potential terrorist to the FBI. The FBI had tracked me down and discovered that I worked for the Navy and then turned the investigation over to NCIS.

During the interrogation, I admitted to DMing two strangers and telling them I worked for the Navy. Because I had done this, Special Agent Smith told me that they would have to review my security clearance. At that particular location at the time, about the only way to get fired was to lose your security clearance. My wife and I had just discovered we were pregnant with our second child. Our first child left my wife extremely ill, and we had initially suspected she was pregnant because she was beginning to get sick again. Special Agent Smith told me that if I wasn't going to lose my security clearance, I wouldn't hear from him again. However, if there were any issues with my clearance, I would hear about it in 3-4 months and could address it then. Special Agent Smith also instructed me to keep quiet about the incident and questioning and sent me on my way.

By the time I left the NCIS office, my wife was panicking. I had disappeared off the face of the planet for a couple of hours and was not answering my cell phone. I returned home, and broke down in tears while I tried to explain to my poor, panicked wife what had happened.

My wife and I anxiously waited for news about my clearance, trying not to tell anybody about what was happening out of fear of facing some sort of additional punishment. My wife's health continued to deteriorate with the pregnancy that almost ended her life. Even after 4 months had passed, we still felt it hovering over us for quite some time.

Through all of this, my bosses found the incident quite humorous. One of them laughingly told a group shortly after the questioning, ""They asked me if I would be surprised if nothintooseahear flew a plane into a building tomorrow? I told them nothintooseahear was as American as apple pie!"" While he told the group of his experience, I just cringed, fearing retribution from NCIS and feeling extremely embarrassed for fucking up in the first place. After a couple of years, my wife and I saw the humor in the situation and have been able to laugh about the experience since.

WorshipMeifYouMust,c00vot,"We drove up to the top of a high mountain pass in Utah. The drive back down is consistently downhill for around 12 miles (cyclists love it). I was driving with three others in the car. To save gas I turned off the car as we coasted. A girl in the back noticed and asked, hey is the engine off? I said yes. She said really? And I said you tell me! And I then turned the key and removed it and tossed the key chain into the back seat. 

Big mistake.  Big big mistake. 

As we entered the next winding turn, the steering wheel locked! It would not turn. I yelled oh no as we careened towards the edge.  I stomped on the brakes, only to find the power assist was not working (obviously, in retrospect).

So we shot off the road.  Miraculously we only caught about six feet of air before landing on a dirt road that ran just below the main road road. As we learned, it was part of an old mining road no longer used. When we landed on the road, the right front tire peeled off the rim, and the rim went into the dirt about a foot. 

We were lucky. Other curves have drops of over a thousand feet.

rawwson,c622st,"I was putting some work signage away in a tiny storage cupboard on the parking level of our joint office building. 

I waltzed in, put the signage in and turned back to the door. I turned the handle; it didn't open. It had locked behind me.

This 2x2 cupboard isn't somewhere people in my office frequent.  In fact, my collegues have said they didn't even know we had it.

I didn't have my phone on me either, which is a rarity. 

I was all good for the first few minutes, banging on the door, yelling for help. 

Then I panicked and lost it. We have construction in the building next door to us so I was convinced noone could hear my calls for help over the standard construction noise. My mind literally went to being a missing person on TV and being found a week later, traumatized and near-dead. 

I screamed the most high-pitched blood curdling scream. I have never in my life had so much panic inside me to scream like that. Like, 'about to be murdered' or 'I've been kidnapped' kind of scream.

BonesyWhufc,c7sl9r,"Bit of a clickbait title, I havent brushed them properly, but i still tried :(

I’m currently on holiday with my girlfriend, which means we’re doing everything together including brushing our teeth. 
I do my usual routine, squirt the toothpaste in my mouth, get some water, gargle it, spit it out and then use my toothbrush to scrape the extra gunk off my teeth.

She calls me a fuckin idiot and laughs and asks me if I’m taking the piss, to which she shows me the correct way of brushing teeth, absolutely gamechanging. Every time those posts that arise on twitter saying “do you wet your toothbrush before or after the toothpaste?” I would always think “what idiot would wet it before? It would dry out by the time you finish gargling” right? Wrong.

On a positive note, the foam from the toothpaste is so light and fluffy I love it so much!

bramdebaas,c7eb7h,"*Original post from teenagers but I thought you guys like this story too.*

Okay so this happened to my friend this week and i'm still laughing.

My best friend (17M) has a girlfriend for over a year now and they fuck like rabbits, they fuck on a really regular basis. School is done in my country and they spend a lot of time sleeping together (obviously). So this thursday morning they woke up and my friend was crazy horny (his words, not mine) so they start fucking. Well, this time it didn't go too well. He was almost done when he noticed a little red liquid. He pulls it out and his dick is bleeding like a pig. His frenulum (that little thing that keeps your foreskin in place) was completely ruptured. He tried to clean it and not freak out but the blood was flowing like a waterfall. His girlfriend freaked the fuck out and he called his doctor.

The doctor said he should come as fast as possible. Which he did. Fast forward to the doctor, SHE tried to stop the bleeding by pinching his dick, but it wouldn't stop. The doctor said this could mean that his artery was ruptured, and that meant he could bleed to dead because he fucked too hard. He was sent to the hospital and had to tell his mother, who didn't know he was sexually active. But he couldn't go with an ambulance and his mother doesn't have a drivers license. So he had to call his conservative grandma and explain the situation to HER (seriously, this is too good).

In the hospital, the Penis doctor (urologist) took a look at his dick, she was really worried about the bleeding. So the only option for him not to die was to get an anesthetic with a needle in the tip of his dick and cauterize the wound. You think a kick in the balls is painful? You probably never had this problem then. Every muscle in his entire body stiffened when the needle went in his dick.

He survived, but his dick is purple and he's not allowed cum for a month. So it's gonna be a no nut July for him.

TLDR: My friend bleeded so much out of his dick that he almost died. And now he has to do no nut July.

Edit: In your language it's called a torn fremulum. It can happen to everyone with a foreskin while masturbating or having sex. But with 99% of the people it will stop bleeding eventually. So don't worry when your dick is bleeding, only worry when it's bleeding like a waterfall :)",tifu,TIFU by fucking too hard and almost bleeding to death
throwwawwwwwwway,c779f6,"Throwaway, obviously. This just happened a couple hours ago and I'm still freaking out, since my whole apartment staff is probably going to hear about the fucked up things I do in my free time.

My twisted ass has been getting into hands-free orgasm and hypnosis type stuff lately. Basically there are audio clips that you listen to and go into this sort of trance, and it eventually leads up to an intense hands free orgasm, like nothing I've ever experienced. So I've done it a decent number of times, and I'm getting more and more confident in my routine. My wife has no idea I do this because well, it's super fucking embarrassing that I'm into this. So I usually wait until she's working on days I have off, or do it in hotel rooms when I travel for work.

This leads to today... My wife was at work so I locked the door, turned out all the lights, stripped down, threw on my noise canceling headphones, and laid down on my bed. The audio I tried today was much longer than the ones I usually use because I had some time to kill and found one that sounded interesting. I kept thinking I heard sounds and I would open my eyes and look out my bedroom door, but I'd realize it's just my dog playing in the living room and I'd close my eyes again. This kept happening and it was really distracting, taking away from the experience. So I convinced myself to ignore any sounds I heard and keep focusing on the audio with my eyes closed.

As the intensity built up, I thought I heard a chime sort of noise, or a bell, but at this point I was getting really close and I forced myself to keep my eyes closed and focus. I told myself it was just my dog's collar or something. When I get close with this technique, there's a lot of squirming and clenching, and I'm laying fully nude, flying at full mast. I proceed to... cue the grand finale... I'll spare you the horrible details. I drift back up from the trance and get cleaned up, and throw on my shorts.

When I walked into the the living room, I noticed the entry light was on, which I thought was odd since I turned off the lights. Then I remembered my wife submitted a maintenance request... Sure enough, laying on my counter was a notice that they entered my apartment. Just to make sure, I put my headphones on again and tried ringing the doorbell, which was *definitely* the sound I heard. So I put together the pieces that the maintenance guy entered my unit, and with the work he was doing, he definitely walked right by my bedroom door and saw everything. My awkward, disgusting squirming around, and everything. The only thing I can hope for now is that he doesn't share this miserable story with my entire apartment's staff. Which I am positive he will. I would... And now I can never pick up a package from the leasing office ever again.

Tl;dr: I had a hands free orgasm, and unknowingly gave my maintenance guy a show he'll never forget.

Edit: the first thing my wife said when she got home was ""Hey did they come and fix the A/C?"" I froze and said ""uhhhh, I'm not sure, if they did it wasn't while I was home""

aBurgerFlippinSecond,c1jkez,"Yup.

This just happened about an hour ago, and I just finished patching myself up and crying in the fetal position in shame over my own unbelievable stupidity.

So for context, I live in a medical marijuana state and have my card. Every day after work I come home, give my kitty all of the attention, and roll my post-work blunt. Today was no different than any other day (except after work I went to my parents’ place for Father’s Day, Happy Father’s Day shout out to all dads out there btw) and after snuggling the heck out of my cat, I sat down to perform my green routine.

Since I had worked a full 8 hour day today and spent a few hours of quality family time, I decided to treat myself with a little extra green in the leaf and rolled a little fatter than usual. And for those who aren’t too savvy, in short this means that the ash at the end of the blunt is more stable for longer periods of time, much like a cigar.

As I sat there happily puffing away, I realized that I needed to take a leak, and wandered off to the bathroom, L in hand.

As I stood before the porcelain throne, taking aim at those pesky shit stains, I took another puff of my daily dose. And whilst mid-puff, I noticed that the ash was getting a bit long for my liking, so being the casual stoner that I am I removed the blunt from my mouth and flicked the end of it.

Now I’m no physicist, or astrophysicist, or whatever, but the chances of the following sequence repeating itself are astronomically...*high*.

When I flicked the blunt, I must have hit it near the end (I was about halfway through your standard-sized Swisher) because along with the ash flew the simmering cherry of my swisher sweet. The ember ball flew through the air (my dumb and/or high ass did not notice any of this) and as I inhaled a now-dead blunt, the simmering sphere landed smack in the center of my dick.

You ever hit a blunt or joint and get a Scooby snack? Well I got a supersized Scooby meal. I immediately felt the burning sensation on my most sensitive surface, and immediately gasped as I swatted at my dick to remove the fireball from it. Of course, I straight up dick-slapped myself as I gasped a good amount of weed into my mouth and throat, causing me to violently choke and fall over sideways as I finished pissing all over my shower rug, my bathroom floor, and myself.

I finally stopped choking long enough to inspect myself, and I’ve got a nice burn right in the center of my freshly barbecued genitalia.

Cue the crying, sobbing, fetal position of shame.

TL;DR rolled an L; took an L.

ohhhidk,c4s4yc,"This actually happened on 9/11/2001...I am Muslim and have a very foreign name and didn’t watch the news on that horrible morning. I was in 7th grade and I was the only foreigner in that class. My math teacher immediately brings a TV set in and says “Today, we are not going to be doing any school work.” and before he could finish....for some crazy reason, I decided to yell out “Hell Yeah!” thinking we’re just going to be watching movies or something....And the entire class looks at me...and I didn’t realize why I was the only person out of the entire class who had a huge smile on their face....until he turns the TV on....and boy, did I feel terrible...not only did I look like a careless, racist jackass, but I felt like one too....for the rest of the class, I watched the news and actually apologized at the end of the class. They understood my situation and forgave me, but damn, it was terrible. lol

JonathanMBerman,c6m8k9,"I was on a flight and during the descent the pressure change really hurt my ears. I tried everything to equalize pressure, the Valsalva maneuver, chewing, and yawning. My right ear got supper muffled, painful and developed a loud ringing.

For a few days I just assumed there was some kind of barotrauma to my TM. Either a bruise or a puncture and it would heal after a few weeks so there was no point in having it looked at.

After two weeks with no improvement, I bought one of those ear flush kits from a pharmacy just in case it was wax, and tried to soften it and flush it out. It did it three times, with no improvement.

I figured it must either be a large puncture that I can't afford to have fixed, or some kind of permanent cochlear damage that can't be fixed. It was really obnoxious not to be able to hear on that side. I could't participate in conversations, I couldn't enjoy music, or really watch TV, or listen to audio-books or podcasts easily.

Six weeks later, I'm leaving my current job. My health insurance at the new job doesn't start for 60 days, and the crappy gap insurance I got for the interim has a huge deductible. I figure I might as well get it looked at, so I made an appointment with a nurse practitioner.

She looked in the left side-- all clear. Right side she couldn't see the TM because of wax.

She got another nurse to come flush out my ear. Checked it again-- still wax. Flushed again, still wax. Flushed again, still wax. After about 45 minutes and several flushes finally a huge chuck of wax detached from my TM.

Holy shit I can hear again, no ringing, normal volume. I could have had this done in an hour back in May and I'd have been hearing the whole time. I'm listening to the air conditioning now.

TL;DR  I thought I permanently damaged my hearing on a plane so I didn't bother to get it looked at. It was just a fuck ton of wax",tifu,TIFU by assuming I had permanent hearing loss for six weeks

Vitamin-S_e_e,byvb25,"Backstory: I'm hella pale. Like HELLA pale. The little kids at my K-12 school used to think I was a vampire. I used to get made fun of all the time. I'm on the swim team, I go outside all the time, I'm just really fucking pale. It's literally just my skin tone. I used to get sunburnt at night when I was a baby... Wait maybe I am a vampire...

So this was about three years ago. I've been wearing makeup since I was around the 13. I usually bronze it up and add a little blush to make myself look less dead. So one day, I wake up hella late and don't have time to put on makeup (9th grade, first time not wearing makeup to high school). My friends don't really even notice though, they just think I'm sick or have given up on trying.

I go straight to my math class and am four minutes late, tops. My teacher tells me I have to go to the office and get a tardy note. Oof. I head into the office and say,
""Can I get a late slip?"" The lady starts squinting at me.

""Are you in the play?"" At this point I realize they're actually gonna make me take a late slip for being four minutes late and now I have to do detention for not having an excuse.

""No. Are you thinking I'm Tristan?"" I look a lot like this girl who's playing the lead in the Alice in Wonderland play and get mistaken for her by some of the teachers.

""No... It's just... You've got an awful lot of makeup on... It just makes your face look so white. I think it might be distracting to the other students."" I think smoke starts to come out of my tear ducts as my brain tries to work out what she just said.

""I'm not wearing makeup."" This is pretty much the only response I can come up with. She looks at me like I just tried to buy cigarettes at a store with my mom's ID.

""I just think maybe you should take some off so you don't distract the students. It's very pale."" I'm now glaring at her with our eyes locked. My face is a darker color than my arm. I'm slightly offended so I just wanna leave.

""Can I just have my late slip?"" She looks annoyed and says,

""I'm sorry. You'll distract the other kids."" I'm a little shocked at this point.

""I can't go to class because I'm too pale?"" She rolls her eyes and says,

""That's just way too much makeup for school.""

I fucking leave. My bad for being too white, mam.

More like Yesterday I Fucked Up. God! Just thinking about it makes want to go jump in a lake. 

Anyway, yesterday was our Saturday monthly movie night where a bunch of my friends get together, get super baked and binge on Series or Movies. We decided on Black Mirror since season 5 had just come out. 

Couple of joints later, we started watching episode 1. I don't know if any of you experience this, but when I get high, I get hyper focused on a single thing and forget about anything else in my peripherals. This is exactly what happened to me during that episode. I became so focused I forgot that there were 5 other people around me. And Then I started getting turned on. It's was an incredible feeling, like you become aware of every nerve in your body. Every single movement you make, every single touch on your skin feeling like a bolt of electricity is pulsing throughout your whole body. 

I get hotter and hotter as the episode progresses, feeling like my clit was connected directly to a live wire, until we reach the Birthday VR Scene where I completely lose my self and cum like my life depended on it. I didn't even realize I was moaning until I was done and realized that all my friends were looking at me with one of them holding her phone which was pointed at me. Probably filmed the whole thing. It was so mortifying. I felt like a bucket of cold water had just been dumped on me. I left and went home immediately after that.

I'm so embarrassed!!

My friends keep calling but I'm not planning on talking to them any time soon. Just until the shame wears off.

Probably not gonna work since they know where I live.

TL;DR Got high with a bunch of friends and watched Black  Mirror. Ended up having an Orgasm while watching one of the VR Scenes in episode 1.

Update: My friends came over. I woke up and found them in my apartment (I'm not sure how I feel about my spare key being used like this). Apparently, since I was avoiding them, they decided to come to me. They were really cool about. I mean, they made fun of me, but in a nice way. They wanted me not feel in any way ashamed of what happened. They were pretty awesome. 
My friend apologized for filming me. I forgave her cause she looked like she really felt awful about it and we deleted the video. 
Watched it though. Not as bad as I thought it would be. I wasn't as loud as I thought I was.

sugarbb_throwaway,c4jine,"So, a couple months ago I was struggling financially - I was out of a job and barely staying afloat with student debt. I'm in my early 20s, and I decided to sign up for a sugar daddy dating app. Several of my friends had done it and had great experiences - a lot of these guys are INSANELY loaded, and you don't even have to sleep with anyone if you don't want to. A lot of them are lonely and just want someone to go out with.

Within a week, I was talking to someone. We got along really well actually, I got lucky. We go on dates and weekend trips, and in return he covers some costs for me and buys me shit. It's great.

Well, this week he gave me a thousand to help with my student loans. I was blown away, thanked him profusely and immediately made a loan payment.

Two days later, I get a text from my mom.

""holy cow, where did you get that kind of money?""

*Fuck.* My mom is the cosigner on my loan and has access to the same account. She had seen the payment. I hadn't made one in months, and I'd never paid more than $150 at one time.

At this point I should mention that I'm a guy. While she tries to suppress it, my mother is deeply homophobic, and pretty socially conservative all around. Me coming out to her on it's own would be a shitstorm, let alone telling her that I'd become a fucking sugar baby.

I responded. ""I can't really talk about it""

""why? what's going on?""

""I can assure you that I didn't do anything illegal or sell my body. lol""

Then an idea hit me.

""I signed an NDA, sorry""

 ""what?!""

She called. I told her I was sorry but I really couldn't tell her or I'd be in huge legal trouble. What I didn't consider was that that implied whoever I signed the NDA with had the power to both a.) completely fuck me over legally and b.) somehow know if I told a single family member. Being conspiracy-headed as she is, she figured I was involved in some shady government project.

Anyway, now my mom thinks she's being monitored and won't respond to my texts. My sugar daddy thinks it's hilarious. I do not.

JustABrownBoi,c7wfwb,"This took place last night.

&amp;#x200B;

First, some background. I decided to spend my summer living and working on campus at the college I attend. It's a pretty small college already, and there are even fewer people here over the summer. As such, opportunities to meet cute girls are few and far between. I've been putting myself out there a bit and hanging out with groups I'm not a part of, and so I've met a few girls over the past few weeks who I don't really know too well yet.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the TIFU. Most days, my friends and I (4 college dudes, important) get together and cook ourselves a meal around 9 or 10 pm, since the dining halls are closed by then. Our dorm doesn't have a kitchen, so we walk over to one of the other ones that does, and is close by. This particular night, I realized I left my phone back in my room, so my friends go on without me while I go grab it and catch up. As I'm entering the building, I hear knocking on one of the windows and look up to see two girls smiling and waving at me. I can't for the life of me recognize them, but chalk it up to them being some of the girls I've met these past few weeks. I wave back, enter the building, and immediately go brag to my friends about the myriad of female attention I have just received. They're still setting up to cook, so I decide to go figure out who the girls actually were, and one of my thirstier friends decides to join me.

&amp;#x200B;

We're making our way over when we're greeted by the sight of five or so adults staring at us as soon as we enter the common room. Nothing unusual, the dorms are used by a host of different groups over summer, so we just keep walking through until one of these supervisors calls out to us:

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor1: Hey, where are you going?

&amp;#x200B;

Me, ThirstyFriend: . . .

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor1: This dorm being used by XYZ high school summer camp, and this is a girls dorm. You shouldn't be here. (Normally my college has mixed dorms but I guess they set it up differently for this group)

&amp;#x200B;

Me (being a complete idiot): Oh so these aren't \[my college\] girls?

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor2: No. These are XYZ high school kids.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I mumbled something about girls waving but I was too freaked out at the moment to remember what exactly it was. ThirstyFriend and I left immediately, and made our way back to the kitchen thinking that was that. We had a good but nervous laugh about it. That was, until campus security showed up.

&amp;#x200B;

Security: Hi. Do you guys live here?

&amp;#x200B;

Us: No, we live in \[dorm\].

&amp;#x200B;

Security: We were notified that some students were going around this dorm. There are minors in this building, and you can't be here. Are you guys cooking?

&amp;#x200B;

Us: Yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Security: Alright, let me see what I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

\[A few minutes later\]

&amp;#x200B;

Security: So I talked to dispatch, and since this dorm is going to be used by the camp for the rest of summer, we're going to have to restrict your access to it. You can finish cooking but after that, you can't use this kitchen anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, they asked for our college IDs and took down our names/ID numbers, asked us how long until we're done, and then left. HUGE BONUS TIFU: StupidFriend then promptly set off the fire alarm by burning butter, which required the evacuation of all these kids out on to the street at 11 pm. We packed up our stuff mid-cooking and escaped through an exit at the backside of the building, roaming campus with hot cookware looking for a new kitchen to call home.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Girl waves at me through a dorm window, I decide to go talk to her. Turns out she's a high school kid and now I can't access that dorm anymore.",tifu,TIFU by trying to talk to a girl that waved at me and making campus security's watchlist
plee0410,byex0g,"It was my friend's 18th birthday this week, so we thought to surprise him with a surprise party. One of the activities we set up was a giant-ass slip-n-slide.

So, here we are at the party and enjoying ourselves, 5 of us decided to wrestle in the soapy puddle at the end of the whole contraption. Being wet and all, we accumulated quite a bit of grime and proceeded indoors to shower.

With the large number of people soaked with soap, dirt, and grass, by the time us 5 got inside both the upstairs and the downstairs showers were occupied. Not deterred, we waited patiently and slowly began to freeze.

I guess the cold must've killed off our brain cells, because by the time the downstairs shower was freed up all of us decided to squeeze into it in hopes of getting warm. 5 grown-ass men, in a shower designed for one.

At first, things went well. We were reasonably maneuverable and the soap from the slip-n-slide helped wonders. During the whole commotion, we decided to rotate as one homogenous mass in the shower. We locked into position, five men in a circle, and commenced rotation.

Somehow we popped the entire shower enclosure off its frame. Clean off.

Naturally, we got a little paranoid. As a final testament of our lack of brain capacity, we decided to have one person shower at a time. Thankfully, I was the first one in. The other four held up the frame from outside.

One of the glass panes came tumbling down outwards, falling on two people, completely shattering, and covering the whole bathroom floor with glass.

One person got a chunk of flesh sliced off leg, one got sliced eyebrow, the rest of us looked like were crusted with diamonds.

In the end, while we stood awkwardly half-naked in and out of the shower, somebody got a vacuum and gradually dug us out. Emergency room was attended to.

TLDR: Five guys showered together, didn't quite work out and injury was sustained.

orwoah,c2k6my,"So this happened last Thursday and i’m still in disbelief.

Here’s a bit of background. My girlfriend and I have basically been together since last November without her dad officially knowing about our relationship. He knows that we “like each other” but doesn’t know exactly that we are together.

I was invited to a barbecue at her house by her dad because he really likes me and always asks to take me out with my girlfriend and him.

I get there and we don’t really do anything other than watch some movies and talk in her room. At one point our teenage hormones get too much for us to handle after making out for 10 minutes and we do the deed.

We take a break for precaution just in case anyone came upstairs for any reason and put on the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

We were watching the movie normally until at one point she decided to roll over on her stomach exposing her butt (not nude) but i could resist so I lay down next to her and rest my head on her butt.

As i’m resting my head against her butt I decide to tease her a bit by kissing it and grabbing it and at one point i had my face in it and at that exact moment, her dad walks in to call us for dinner.

Both of us jump up in shock and her dad looks at us and does a 180 the fastest i’ve ever seen a human move. He walks downstairs faster than the speed of light and my girlfriend and I look at each other in shock. Our hearts are racing 100000mph as we look down the hall and prepare for the walk downstairs not knowing what’s going to happen.

We go downstairs and everything seems normal, everyone is serving themselves food, her dad is talking to his girlfriend and smiling, and he tells us to come serve ourselves. My girlfriend and I are still panicking and we make it very very obvious by asking many questions and trying to somehow make him forget about what he saw. Didn’t work.

As i’m about to head upstairs to eat, my girlfriend trails behind me but is stopped dead in her tracks by her dad and whispers to her in the most angry and scary voice i’ve ever heard come out of him “i never want to see you two on the same bed again.” My heart drops and i’m sure her’s does too. We walk up the stairs in shame and eat what we can due to the complete loss of appetite.

Her and I brainstorm ideas on what’s going to happen to us and being me, I can’t keep myself calm. She puts her head down not knowing what to do and we both come to an agreement that we were bound to get caught someday.

Some time goes by and her dad and his girlfriend come upstairs to go to their room and before he walks in he tells me “I’m not mad at you, she should just know better” and closes the door to his room.

A few minutes go by and he tells us to come watch netflix with him and his girlfriend in their room. He acted so normal it was almost unsettling.

I think about this so much and get so embarrassed every time and will never see her dad the same way again. He could probably say the same for me.

This did happen just now though and im still cringing.

Me and my girlfriend have been going out for 10 months now so we are very... cuddly
Ive given her many hickeys before because we find it hilarious and she (somehow) enjoys it. 2 days ago she decided to start kissing my neck and i didnt even feel it so i didnt notice. About 10 minutes later i look down and it looks like I've been shot by a bb gun all over my chest.

We start laughing and she stops and i think nothing of it. ""I give them to her all the time and its never been a problem"" i thought to myself. I go to bed after she leaves.

What i forgot is she wears a shirt when she sleeps and i dont. Mum comes in to my room the next morning and sees my chest and starts freaking out. I tell her ""i dont feel anything, maybe its just hayfever"". Luckily that calms her down and im in the clear.

This morning, however, mum says ""Hows your rash?"" While im eating breakfast with the whole family.

Shit.

Dad goes full panic mode shouting at me to get a glass and press it on the ""rash"" to make sure its not meningitis and tells me to take off my shirt. My brother and sister burst into laughter. They know exactly what it is.

""ITS A HICKEY"" yells my sister
""It cant be, its too small"" my mum replies (my girlfriend is small so they were quite small""

Ive gone bright red and keep saying ""i dont know what a hickey is""

Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad.

moby323,ak2k64,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”.

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

Oh, and if you can read this, I’ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

notsobigafterall1,bo6nut,"So this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

My dentist is a very nice and professional man. Our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" My immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! You've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time.

Sonums,bndou6,"Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, “Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they’re just boring and far too controlled”. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...’Hitlerish’. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I didn’t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let’s see what I go back to now...

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

EDIT: Thank you for the gildings you’re all giving me, it’s rather overwhelming.

The original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. 

As of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won’t necessarily be responding to them all.

I’m really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn’t the original intention, but it’s a great positive to take away from this experience!

EDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-

EDIT 3: UPDATE - It’s now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it’s back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they’ve subsided and I’m feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn’t think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

EDIT 4: Finally I’m able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it’s been a truly interesting experience. I didn’t realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn’t expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It’s 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

EDIT 5: Final edit, I’m now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It’s been great to see this happen, and I’m sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

536f646f6d7920,b498i2,"TLDR at the bottom- 

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I’m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my “intentions” where with the video and that he’s never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


TLDR: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out I send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

OdinsBHole,bvu086,"My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman’s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, “Dad, I’m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?” Well, my son isn’t really a fighter. He’s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he’s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he’s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don’t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. “Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.” I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. “I warned him.” I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn’t think he would and he did it.

EDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn’t malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn’t do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn’t the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully’s brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he’s disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!

HollowsOfYourHeart,by23vn,"My friend Jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and I finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.

dvdasacargiveaway,b8mhmf,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

Wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*Edit 2*

I don't think I'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn't change any names

Two months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. 

Basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, ""I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. 

I didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""Oh fuck,"" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""Hey [my name], how was your break?"" 

I looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, ""Is that all your having for lunch?"" and I was like, ""Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

Then he said, ""Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?"" 

I was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. 

Well. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?"" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you."" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

Even with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

Well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

We have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I'm a girl (got two comments asking if I was).

After  a few minutes of mindless wandering, I notice her on the other side of  the store. I also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as I'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, I hear someone behind me shout ""HEY CREEP! WHY ARE YOU  TAKING A PICTURE OF THAT GIRLS ASS!?"" I turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

I  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. My wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that I had to leave. She explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&amp;#x200B;

The employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. Honestly I'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. It was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. Shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DRI took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. My wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. Everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

And before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows I do this. Yes, my wife is more than okay with it. She does the same thing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. The manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. I'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again. 

Edit2: I have asked the wife if I can share a picture and she has declined. Sorry folks, enjoy this [tiny ass](https://m.imgur.com/aqQoeRa?r) as compensation. ",tifu,TIFU by taking a picture of my wife's ass
sisyphusisnthappy,alfq4j,"Well, fuck. 

Not a throwaway because I have no shame left to feel. 

TIFU by orgasming so many times I went blind in one eye. That’s right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

Seriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory “not technically today”) but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I’m off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren’t batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here’s the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I’m jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can’t come on my own if my head isn’t under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I’ve only slept for four hours. I’m losing my mind. 

Anyway, at this point I’m abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I’d put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

I’m sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn’t. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I’m bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? 

Once my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I’ve ever done. 

I continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn’t go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of “what the fuck have i done” red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

Now I’ve got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I’ll probably have to cancel. I’ve been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can’t even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I’m shit out of luck. 

TL;DR: I masturbated and now I’m
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

EDIT: Sweet baby jesus’s clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn’t stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I’ve never been more grateful for the colloquialism “booty”). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.

EDIT #2: Clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. To clarify: I’m bi. Also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, I guess.",tifu,TIFU by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.
Donthitsubmit3,bgvmdp,"So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't “work”. This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a “real” job I was cutting and running from this work.

Well, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

So, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

I want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.

Tl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor “want's to talk” and I want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

obligatory update:

Well, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won't lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

I ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn't agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.

He had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""Customer\_Commission\_2nd draft.doc""). I've taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

I gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

Like I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",tifu,TIFU by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.
tbonepwn,a364ea,"So this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  She called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. I started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if I took a picture. To be funny I included my man parts in the photograph.  When she got home, I asked her how she liked the picture I had sent. She seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what I was talking about.

DigitalCricket,abi9ar,"My cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of THC chocolate for Christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. My parents are 75-year old Republicans. That was a big maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. You put half a candy bar down and YOINK, gone when you come back.

&amp;#x200B;

You can guess what happened. My mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. Her last words, high as a kite, were ""I think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&amp;#x200B;

They took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. At which point I assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the RedBull Orbit Jumper.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. So now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

&amp;#x200B;

Obligatory gold edit: Thanks all for your well wishes! ! A few things to clear up - Mom went into the hospital on Saturday. As of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan where she awaits surgery details. I'm in Canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but I'm planning to head back down to NY this weekend to be with her. Also....OP is not a dude. :)

Second update from my dad: Mom's surgery may be Thursday, with the holidays and all. I decided not to mention that I put the story on the internet.

FP Edit - Thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. I'm headed back to the States on Thursday, the tentative surgery date. Will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

UPDATE - Mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. Thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. All of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

Check out my adorable mom

Help23andme,b6uh51,"Throwaway account.

We've all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

I couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. 

Without even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

My irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""What kind of question is this? Of course not."" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

I left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. 

For the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. 

I feel like fucking shit. Ik it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. Fuck my life

TLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I've locked myself in my room and I'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

JamaicanJ,arh3qu,"This is long so TLDR at the bottom.

This happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that’s where the pee came out.

So one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that’s certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

So armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom’s bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

After about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I’ve ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. 

I cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.

So this was about 10 days into my stretching and I’d gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I’d try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn’t bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn’t care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn’t budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That’s how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

When I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I’d check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I’m a black guy.

I realized that if I didn’t find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. 

I checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

Also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren’t as stupid as I was don’t take that risk lol

TL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn’t get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

EDIT: So I didn’t expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

So while I’m happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, I’d like to clear up something. This post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. Circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  Rather, I’d like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

For those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. Don’t be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. They have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. For those of you who aren’t old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. Believe me it’s not as awkward that you think. Don’t risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

My husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. He put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my Apple Watch. I didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

So we get into it, and he's spanking me and I'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. Hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly I hear from my watch ""Ma'am, I hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. We are sending someone to you. Hold tight."" 

""Did you call 911???"" My husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

So I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

I said okay thank you, and I hung up.

""The police are coming.""

Shit. I'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. Within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. We put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

I calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. I didn't mention the spanking.

Apparently my husband did. Another police officer comes in and asks about our BDSM contract. ""He told you about our contract?""

""He felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show State of Mind.""

I go get our contract and showed it to the officers. After a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the Apple Watch if we're going to do that again.

CharmingExplanation,a1n8l6,"My wife posted earlier today on LA about this. Not using my main because my FIL knows it and I'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

I went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. I had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when I turned it on. Most of them were asking how I could do this. I had no clue what she was talking about. She didn't answer any of my calls back.

I got home and she was packing up to leave. I'll admit it, I cried. A lot. Had no clue what was happening or what I did. Finally, it comes out that I texted her that I wanted a divorce. She showed me the text and I immediately realize what happened.

This morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. I texted her ""the new mirror came in! I'm going to try to put it together but I may need your help later"". I had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. I texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point I think I need to just give up"". Apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. So my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while I was off thinking everything was great. She even called a divorce lawyer.

Things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. She told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

\-I usually work from home unless I need to meet with clients. I don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway.

\-My wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. That's why she had the reaction she did.

\-My comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. Neither of us is mad at the other. This was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. We're fine. I posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. No need to psychoanalyze my wife or PM me about divorce. We are fine.

My boyfriend and I are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. We got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. We're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. I started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so I figured on going to completion. Unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

I freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. Meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. Eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

Anyways, it's 5:40am, I've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

TL;DR: Bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

Update @7:31am - Thanks for all the reassuring comments. My bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. Anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. More to come.

Update @8:38am - Of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... Anyways thanks! So breakfast started off totally fine. I mean, yeah I was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. That is, until I excused myself to go shower. She stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. But then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". It was sweet and cringy all at once. I guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

Anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

Update: A lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. Actually I assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); I didn't actually see her do it. I asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while I was...ehm...cleaning.",tifu,TIFU by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door
Jessie5681,ao5tzy,"Okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. Basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

Obviously I think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though I've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. So, for some stupid reason, I decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. I set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

After a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after I showed this to him, I saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

Queue my surprise when a couple of days later I check the tinder account I had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and I could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

I confronted him and he denied it but I mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. Obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity I checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. So now the tinder I made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

TL;DR: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

Edit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up! Thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. It honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. 

Also, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because I’m apparently pretty good at it.

gaythroowaway,bgg9b5,"So I have an uncle (we will call him J) who has always been VERY vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. There is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

Well this weekend in between family gatherings I was looking to meet somebody . I started chatting with an older man because that's how I roll. A lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so I don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. We actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics I wish I could unsee and sending a few I wish I could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

So I'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . It is at this moment I realize my FU, I've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  He tried to play it off like a random encounter but I wasn't letting him get away with that. After some pressing he finally admits that he is the man I've been talking to and I told him I don't judge him like he does me . He apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

He kept talking with me like he was still INTERESTED and I had to make it clear that was NOT going to happen . I had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him I had to go ahead and block his number. I can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

Always get a face pic, people.

TL:DR: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . Should have insisted on the face pic

Edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but I'll answer some pressing questions . I did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who I was . It is pretty disturbing to say the least. As far as blackmail goes I have everything saved but I don't plan on doing anything with it as I think that could actually put me in danger . This man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

burn320948,b5pk1a,"Right off the bat I want to say that I am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. This was not a prank gone wrong, or something I did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. Burner for reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened a couple of weeks ago. I tripped and sprained my ankle. It's been bothering me enough that I've been taking Epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. In addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, I also find it incredibly relaxing. Say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, I enjoy a good soak.

&amp;#x200B;

I also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. It's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...I call them old man spots. They're harmless, and most of the time I don't even notice, BUT every once in a while...I'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. Additionally it takes FOREVERRR to get the bleeding to stop...its not like I can elevate my balls, Let alone put a band aid on...

&amp;#x200B;

Well...on the day in question, I get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. So, I get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. It's not really important how I did it, but I ended up nicking one of those spots. So, after cursing a reasonable amount, I start the lengthy ritual of holding TP against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. Even after the bleeding stops I have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...Well I finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. I put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&amp;#x200B;

 I wasn't asleep but I was really zoned out and relaxed...until I was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. I've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. It scared the shit out of me, and I jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. I shouted ""HONEY? WHAT THE FUCK!""  She didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  It took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""Jesus Christ!"".....I could see what it must look like to her... I had apparently NOT stopped the bleeding as well as I thought I had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a long time to calm her down, and I don't think that's something you just get over. Hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though I thought I had. Took a bath, zoned out. Wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact I was bleeding into the water and thought that I had killed myself. Sorry honey.

[deleted],bdwybq,"Dear lord. On my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so I clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

This is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read. 

I now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.

I know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising. 

I know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

I know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife’s room.

In reading through the comments he’s made to others, I’ve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.

Overall, I wish I never clicked that first comment. I know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

TL;DR. Accidentally discovered my son on reddit. Found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, I shouldn’t have read all of it. And some posts I stayed away from. And honestly, I didn’t realize it right-right away. The first post I read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. It was after another that I really put the pieces together. And yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. But hey, life isn’t always fair.

atokachase,b0z6h7,"This actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of “not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices” and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

Fast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. After a couple of one-off messages that don’t really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. Except for two problems.

The first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It’s not good. For six years, I’d still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.

So I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, “hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it’s just me.” Luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.

I went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I’d never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. For the third movie (which I can’t remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. And this is where the second problem comes in. 

After my breakup in 2016 and realizing I’d been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.

And so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like “holy fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and “What about this position?” “OUCH!” “Oh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can't see.” We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

If this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven’t done any cardio in your fucking life. And jesus christ the sweat. So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. At one point our chests become suction cupped together. I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn’t felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. No matter how ready either of y’all are when you start out, after two hours, it’s gonna wear off. We both felt like we’d attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life. 

Well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. It's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke and at this point it’s about 6am. I’m wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she’s only in a bathrobe. We sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (She had just moved back home before finding a new place). So not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now I get to meet her mom for the first time! GREAT! I'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. Somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent Tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. Life is fucking weird.

Well, the reason I am posting this on March 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we’re engaged to be married on March 14th of 2020. Our sex life is FAR better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. I mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

TL;DR I met up with a Tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. Now we’re engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




EDIT: Just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! I am still wholly undecided if I will ever show her this post. It's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. We'll see though. And thank you so much for the gold and silver! Did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. And for those asking, I've changed my dosage on my SSRI and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. Talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! And also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. He didn't pan out. Within three months, her mom got hit up by several Tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. Tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

EDIT2: Holy damn! Platinum?? Thank you kind stranger! I guess now I probably have to show this to my fiancée to which she will reply, ""I have no idea what any of that means. Good for you, I guess?"" I still love her.

EDIT3: A few of y'all keep asking, ""why in TIFU?"" Well, let me tell ya, if I had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. Even worse than my breakup the year before. Not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? Yeah, that sucked. Just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't SUCK ASSSSS on the whole. I mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk

FINAL EDIT: For real y’all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations.

CriticallyNormal,ar7bq1,"This fuck up mainly involves three people me [M32], my wife [F27] and her sister [F25].

So for context a normal Saturday is for my wife and I to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

This week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

So off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

Now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our Saturdays.

As we are about to leave her sister says ""Have fun"" in a cheeky way which I completely don't pick up on.

My brain decides that as my wife and I spent Thursday together for Valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

So straight after the ""Have fun"" and without consulting my wife, I say ""You can tag along if you like""

The atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and I'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so I double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""As you said it will be fun"".

My wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when I've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

Still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

I've apologised and explained. I know we will laugh about it later but for now I'm playing LEGO lotr on my own. 

TL:DR I asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

Edit: Well this post went nuclear! Oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

A couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend Saturday with our kids. Well I work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. Our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a Saturday.

Yes, I spelt invite as invight, oh well.

As for an update, LEGO Lotr is now being played two player!

TL;DR at the bottom.

So this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

About 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I’d finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I’d brought some with me that I’d recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

Things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn’t helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

So I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It’s a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door’s door is about one meter away from mine. I’d not met anybody on my street yet and didn’t realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of “hello nice to meet you, my name’s (her name), are you new to the area?”

So basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can’t speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were “je voudrais une boulangerie” (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn’t handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said “bonjour”, so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I’d just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can’t speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. 

Fast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I’m in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I’ve perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.
I’d gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn’t let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn’t French. If I had friends come over (I don’t have many so it wasn’t too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. 

Things were going okay and I wasn’t too worried about being exposed anymore because I’d gotten so used to it. I’m not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.

But then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn’t recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend “this is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about”. You might be able to see where this is going. 

Her friend hits me with a question in French that I didn’t understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn’t know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn’t actually French and couldn’t speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I’d been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

I haven’t spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I’d  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

TL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man.

EDIT: I didn’t think this post was going to catch much attention, and I’m praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. Some people seem to have a hard time believing that I thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, I’d like to remind people that when I made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",tifu,TIFU by taking LSD and pretending to be French for 10 months
choppytim,b98uzh,"so today I had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, I’m still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn’t make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story I’m 27 and I live with my girlfriend, we’ve been together for 2 years now and through out that time I’ve seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they’re usually travelling so it’s a little harder to spend time with them. Now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and I for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. We’ve also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

So on top of making porn I’m also an aspiring film editor and I am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but I also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us I’d been editing a new video, usually after editing I go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because I’d always got the vibe they didn’t like me very much. We were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, I immediately said sure and led him into the office, now I could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and I kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. So I lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as I opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst I ejaculated on her face, if that’s not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

I panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn’t want her dad getting us sick also.

Her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and I are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and I’ll keep you updated if anything else happens 



TL;DR I unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won’t talk to us

UPDATE: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so I’ll explain, as I said earlier in the post I watch the video post editing to make sure there’s no problems before uploading, before going to sleep I just shut the laptop without even thinking, I do this often (I know it’s not good but sshh) if you don’t stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. Still haven’t heard from her dad yet. I honestly didn’t expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and I laugh a lot so thank you

I am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  

We get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says “Oh. My goodness, what happened?”  So I respond as a joke “Eh, she got out of line”.   

I know!  It’s horrible. I’m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I’m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It’s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

He comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor’s office to talk.  

There is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth’s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

The police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

The police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

We get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  

The county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don’t need to make for this week.  I can’t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I’m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.

Edit 2:  Update
Thank you for the gold kind strangers.
Wow this blew up.  I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.

2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.

3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  It turned out to be nothing.",tifu,TIFU by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter
midwest_sweatervest,anmb38,"I go to this “mommy and me” thing every week with my daughter. Not because it’s my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as “a Christmas gift” to my one-year-old (AKA she doesn’t think I am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

Anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the Pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. But all these kids know sign language, and I thought that was pretty damn cool. So I start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it’s working! Suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say “more” and “all done” and “drink”! She can call me mom and my husband, dad! Holy shit! Thanks Pinterest moms! I take back all the shit I talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

Well today with my husband out of town, I didn’t feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants I decided to go out for a quick dinner. The kid loves French fries and so do I. So we hit the local burger joint and I order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. The server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and I set it out of her reach so she doesn’t hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. So of course every time she wants some, she signs “drink”. And every time she wants my attention, she signs “dad” because apparently the slightly different sign for “mom” isn’t as fun for her. Ok, whatever. 

Well I notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they’re looking over at us and snickering. I’m like okay, I did like 4 quick google searches, maybe I botched some of what I taught her. It’s fine. But then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iPhone down with a message typed out for me to read. It says something to the effect of “she’s calling you ‘dumb’ and telling you she wants to drink alcohol”. 

I’m like... wait... what? So she continues to show me that I have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for “drink (non-alcoholic beverage)” and “drink alcohol” and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since I am her mom. I can only imagine what the Pinterest moms would’ve done had I shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

TL;DR ASL is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

ETA: Thanks, everyone! I’m glad you all enjoyed this post. Please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that I was trying to teach my child proper ASL. They were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as ASL. They just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

Also please note that I literally searched “baby sign language” and based the signs off of still frames from google. I have no idea how close they were to the real signs. Additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. She speaks English well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. We were always sure to say the words while signing them. She now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that I decided to share with you all. I’m new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen “today”.

charlesdickens2007,altgqo,"We are in the middle of the Polar Vortex. I got a phone call last night saying that I didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

We decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. Well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. I was ready to get laid, because, well, I wanted to. So I told my boyfriend to grab the lube while I climbed on top of him.

The bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/llIJq5V.jpg). I was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

Because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. He squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. Again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

While he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. He couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as I screamed and jumped off him.  The bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

I now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. We sobered up real quick, I fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

She told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

I followed up by saying, ""But sometimes, people can see my butt.""

She started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

So I had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; I wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

I then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to [http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/](http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and I was shocked.

We were both curious where/how I even learned that from.

Was it a potty training error? Apparently not. We asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, &amp; uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

After promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! We're going out this Friday for a dinner. I know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what I happened I think I’m kinda obligated by the universe to go for it.

Yesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

Well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me.

madmoran1029,9pcete,"A few weeks ago I flew out to Fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since I havent seen them in 4 years. The first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. They gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. The conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. The older son ,""Alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at HS and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. On the other hand is my nephew ""Dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. When I pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. Alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and Dan. Being the cool uncle I let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. As she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my Marine Corps days. If he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. But dont go empty handed. I suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. Now that I think of it I was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. So the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 A few days later it occured to all of us Dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. When his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. I however was not buying it. I pulled him aside and got the truth. The boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. He would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. He met a girl and they had been seeing each other. I was happy I could help and could not believe it actually worked. However things went south. 
 A few days after my return to the east coast I received a very emotional call from my sister. She explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""Have you seen this man"" flier on the door. It was a grainy surveillance photo of Dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. The flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. When she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. Now Dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and I told I am not invited for Christmas. Poor Dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So, flashback to undergrad, things are good and I just started dating this beautiful girl that I had met in class. I was enamored with her, shocked that I loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. The first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few months into our relationship, I started to notice some concerning symptoms. As you can probably hypothesize, when I pee'd, it burned. At first, I just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, I decided to stop taking creatine just in case. But, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. I would literally be struggling to stand while I pee'd because the pain was so intense. After, I would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. It was bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, at this point, I was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. No, it had to be what I thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. I hadn't been with anyone else. I hadn't been with anyone else since I began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. I was shocked. Things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had I gone wrong? The thought made my blood boil, until I outright confronted her. I told her I knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. She told me no. I demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. She said sure. (looking back at this I feel like a complete dick). We agreed that we would go the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

The same night I confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. She was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. Around this time my roommates and I had just moved into a new house. In the process all our belongings got shuffled around. As she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" I heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, I've been pissing out bleach?!?! I instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. She took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. Sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared.

TL;DR - Months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when I pee'd. I told my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an STD test.

KnownPay,90ol0e,"This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

Stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

So, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). 

Not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

And so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.

I was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

Somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

I don’t really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

I snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. 

I’m not going to talk about what happened next, as I don’t want to relive the next few moments.

My father is just disappointed. He hasn’t talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

My mother believes that we should “embrace my sexuality”, and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. 

And I'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it’s a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. 

But it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

jaykekz,bqkjde,"Yesterday evening my GF and i thought it would be nice to watch Lord of the Rings after coming home quite late. After aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. She had her ""strawberry week"" so she was plugged, which I frankly didnt care too much about. We just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

I thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

I think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

My girlfriend said: "" WTF are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

After explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my GF couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. Made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling GF.

nodogsaloud,b1ier5,"When I was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. So spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and I thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  I had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
The googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until I had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out I pushed it even further in. I was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. I could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, I stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. After a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

Skip forward to this Tuesday;
I do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and I was submerged under water, after I emerged and pulled my boat out I could hear a slight rattle in my ear and I knew instantly what it was.
It's now Friday and the rattling happens every time I turn my head and I still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

TLDR: Put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... It didn't

UPTATE:
So this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause I think it's abit mental aswell.

However I'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and I'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

Alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and I can honestly say I don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think they're as big of thing in the UK.

Thanks for hearing me out",tifu,TIFU by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today...
FaceFullOfMace,aa9ej2,"So this started 2 weeks ago

I went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. Doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a GF.

 Naturally I start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. I get to teasing him about him not losing his V card, my mom is not liking the conversation. His gf ends up coming over, I stopped the teasing I'm not a monster. So I'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. I tell her not to worry about it I'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

I get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. My argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised Ying and yang I grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. He grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. Saying how a party would be good for him I even offered to go, (I'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, I told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (I know how that sounds). So I finally convinced her she agreed.

So I decide that I need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. I knew my bro was losing it that night. Fast forward to the party, I drop him off so my mom thinks Imma be there. I pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. Bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

Skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. Well holy fuck did I get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. Well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  So now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and I'm becoming an uncle.

TL;DR Convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his V card, he got his gf pregnant. 


Update 1: So she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. So we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. I'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. My brother is getting tested for STI's I was all over him about that. Also thanks for the gold and silver (I have no idea what that does). Thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

Update 2: Everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. My brother does not have any STI's or STD's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,I'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. There are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can DM and I can explain what I did if curious, how I got out, how my life has changed and all. 

Update 3: *in Maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! Mother is crying brother is in shock and the GFs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. Everyone pray for this child. 


Update 4: They are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, I helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. I've started a savings account for him, and my GF and I are going to move into a place with him and his GF to help them out.",tifu,TIFU by making myself an uncle NSFW
SKTisBAEist,boflzw,"I finally get to post a fuck up. Happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

My gf and I were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. Awful game by the way. Anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. The gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

The star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

As she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

Which she immediately did.

I have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and I've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. Nor have I ever been so afraid. She ended the game with 0 stars...

""I will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

The rest of the game was spent in dread. Its now 3am and I'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

thelittlejune,adl8ba,"I am so beside myself with shame that I almost couldn’t bring myself to post this. 

But reddit karma is my mistress and I must heed her sweet call. 

So yesterday was my sister’s birthday (this fu didn’t happen today, yadda yadda), I was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

“Look what mom gave me,” said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

Now, I cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. I looked at that ring in my hand and I just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. My primitive ape brain said “funny joke!”

So I did it.

I think it was the next split second when I saw the horror in my sister’s eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that I realized what a horrible mistake I had made. 

So my little sister runs screaming from my room and I hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as I admitted that I, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister’s ring. No, I didn’t know why I did it. Yes, I am an idiot. No one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

So brief intermission from my sister’s birthday as I make a quick excursion to the ER, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them I was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. They took a couple X-rays and I hung around the ER for about 8 hours before they broke the news that I was going to live (much to my mother’s chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

I shat out the ring this morning. 

Happy birthday sis. 

TL;DR: I am an idiot and I ate my sister’s ring because I thought it would be funny. 

EDIT: good fucking god my inbox. Tune in tomorrow morning and I’ll share a picture of the accursed ring

EDIT 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.

pllaidllama,bxvcyz,"&gt; So for a bit of a light hearted break from all those creepy incest  posts- this actually happened yesterday but I am ready to laugh about it  now.   
&gt;  
&gt;Theres  this other mom at my daughters daycare, and she is hot to trot. She  looks like a buff version of morena baccarin (sp?) and to top it off  shes super cool and fun to talk to. I don't really know her outside of  drop off/pick up time but we're always friendly and make basic chit chat  when we see one another- smile, say good morning, comment on parenting,  etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Well  I recently had a pretty drastic schedule change at work and my husband  became the primary daycare drop off/pick up for about 2 weeks while we  all adjusted. Things settled down and I was able to start being the  primary again, and a few days ago I saw hotpants lady- she was still her  beautiful self, but had put on about 50lbs- I was astonished, she was  always ultra fit, how on earth did she do that in 2 weeks? To top it off  when I said hi the first morning I was back she barely made eye contact  with me and just gave me a half smile and curt nod. I asked my husband  if he noticed the change and he said he just thought maybe her recent  switch from workout clothes to big dresses were making her look bigger.  Maybe? No, she was definitely more voluminous. I spent 2 more days  trying to catch her eye and facing chilly disposition and I finally  decided to try and reinitiate friendly conversation with her.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  ""Hey, I haven't been here for a while, good to see you again! You been  feeling ok?"" Her: ""Oh, yeah, but I haven't been here in months."" Me:  (not catching on) ""Oh? Haha, everything is such a blur with kids, I  never know what day it is anymore"" Her: ""I suppose, but I wouldn't know,  I only watch my nephew when my sister is out of town."" Me: (realization  hitting like a thunder clap) ""oh, OH! So you're..."" Her: angrilly  interupting ""Yes, I'm the fat twin. I've seen you staring at me trying  to figure that out."" She just sort of stalked off, leaving me mortified-  and now I've got to put my husband back on daycare duty for several  days to avoid the humorless wench who has clearly been eating all the  chips on her shoulder.

wsxedcthrowaway,bvg72z,"I’m still trying to process what just happened. Today was my daughters 19th birthday and I wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. I brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something I will never unhear. She was having sex with her boyfriend and saying “please stop it hurts, stop it.” I ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. I was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. I threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. My daughter was frantically explaining to me that it’s a fetish and he wasn’t actually hurting her. I told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and I rushed him to the hospital. He’s doing okay now and isn’t suffering any major injuries but I feel awful. I’m not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and I truly thought he was hurting her.

I’m 23 years old, and I admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

Earlier today I was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. During that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, I thought I would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

I checked four candy dispensers; all empty. One last chance. I opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, I find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. Without any thought or inspection, I excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. At the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…Someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine’s dispenser.

So there I am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as I spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. I’m certain I looked ridiculous, and I’m still brushing my teeth.

takeonethough,brtfpf,"It’s as stupid as it sounds.

Yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her BFFs. They usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

Around that time I’m usually at the gym so to not disturb them. But yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so I went there an hour earlier.

Sometimes after I come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
So I come home early and hear the TV running and I assumed, that she didn’t hear me.
That’s when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

I busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
Her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. Some get red and look away, some stare at me like they’ve never seen a man’s privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved WTF. 

The silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. I uttered a loud FUCK and she instantly replied with: „Good plan, bad execution.“ Her friends all laughed and even I had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

I even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. Of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

Struggling_to_Keto,aj59a1,"Oof

My roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on Sunday night. She usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

A week ago, I ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. I don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. So this was fucking fantastic and I was ecstatic.

My plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so I could sit on it and act like it was my bf. I'm not really experienced in the sex department and I wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so I was going to practice until she got back.

Before I get into the main event. I need to explain the layout of this house. When opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that USED to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. After leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

Since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. However since we got it fixed it's silent.

Now on to the main event. I had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so I could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. Then I pulled out my new toy and I literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

Then I got dressed down to what I would be wearing. It was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath I had my lingerie, I did this so I would be in the head space and so I could I imagine the upcoming day.

At this point I'm on the toy and I had a pretty good groove going and I was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so I grabbed some pillows to support, and then I heard a noise. I fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! I shoo'd him out and continued.

Another couple minutes go by and I can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. Until I realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. I then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and I felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. I heard the suitcase stop and when it did I hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. I was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

Lightbulb!

My shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! I sat myself right back down, turned the TV on Rick and Morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like I had been watching this the entire night.

She came in and saw me and asked why I was sitting like that and I made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and I was just letting it stretch out. She nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. Now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that I was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

We sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. She told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

At this point I'm so sore and by sheer will I'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

The moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. I reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. She does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  I pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


TL;DR: Tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

Update 1: Thanks so much for the lovely gold! It's my first one and it makes me happy! For the record, I am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. I haven't told my bf yet since I'm still a bit embarrassed! But I'm planning on telling him on the day. Also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

Update 2: Since it's being asked alot, the reason I was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. I was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. So there were boxes and all that jazz.

Update: I tried keeping up with all the comments... I give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",tifu,TIFU by having my roomate walk in while I was practicing cowgirl riding...
NewbornNazgul,bxiaua,"*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&amp;A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

Dad: Suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids.

Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...”how long ago did you transition?” I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not.

Obviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.

I spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.

A female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,

""What is your most prized possession?""

I froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

I wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.

So, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""I'm sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)""

We have a 12 yr old son. 

Saturday night after he went to bed, husband and I decided to get a little sex in. After quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the “toy” box. Husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (He was putting new batteries in them, etc). He comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. We wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says “what is that on the table?!”
...I immediately realized the FU. Husband did not so he asks “what is it?” 
Son: a purple banana (ps he’s 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
Cue immediate shame/laughter. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

Side note. We did not use that particular “purple banana” that night-thank god. 

After we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says “what do you want for breakfast?” 
Son says “I lost my appetite” 

I’m still dying inside. I’m sure son is too.

A few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

I suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.

I was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I'll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn't just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I'd been so high for so long so recently.

I saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn't remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

It was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

The bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It'll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.

*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

Nope, it's bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.

""Hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*

To his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn't bothered at all.

So, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*

**Fuck.**

**Me.**

The door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.

I can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. I just wanted to look like a normal human being.

TL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will.",tifu,TIFU by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that I had to be rescued. Then I did something really embarrassing.
NakedNightKing,biqnog,"*I was 16 when this happened. Golden age of fuck ups.* 

I hooked up with one of the girls from my church. We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

So thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the Deacon's daughter. 

*Edit: Thank you for the Silver &amp; Gold!* 

*Edit: Okay, gawd damn. Some of you are sick of all the sex posts. Noted.* 

*Edit: A few of you are asking how my old man reacted. Every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of God. Being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. I was forced to listen to ""rehabilitated"" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the Bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in Christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. I never had sex with the Deacon's daughter ever again.*

kittenonkeyboard22,ba8qvo,"I'm going to preface this TIFU by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. It has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

It was our first Valentine's Day together this year. I woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

I decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. It was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

I needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

This is when things begin to go wrong.

All of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. I glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (He has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


Sure enough, he began to violently seize. I go full protective mode and try to help him. He was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

We're both still naked and I have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

Fight or flight kicks in and I know I must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. I'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. So when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, I go balls to the walls.

I grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*CLACK*


Once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. I drive him to the hospital
And sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. I apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""Babe you fucked me into a seizure..I'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
So not only, on our FIRST Valentine's Day together did I literally fuck him into a seizure, but I also dislocated his shoulder.

Tuturuuuuuuuu,asppfi,"Alright so let’s start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you’ll be like wtf? 

So my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  And more accurately it’s more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife “Mommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom” and off to the races they go. 

Obviously this is a game that both parents play and she’ll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it’s cute and we haven’t gotten any feedback on it.

This brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells “GET MY BOOTY DADDY!” To which I reply nonchalantly “I’m going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom” since her butt was right next to my face. 

I immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling “EAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY” and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it’s too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

I took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I’m dreading picking her up.

TL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I’m going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to initiate the game instead. 

Edit: A word. Also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

There were lots of requests for an update after pickup. All is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

Thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

For those that got offended, sorry? None of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. Cheers!",tifu,TIFU by telling my three year old daughter that I would eat her booty
AngryKitten1207,bq3oy3,"So this actually happened about a week and a half ago. Some pre knowledge. I dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. So the other day I was really hungry and wanted some Panda Express Orange chicken. I texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. I was like “alright sounds good brother see you in a bit”. 
A couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. So naturally I got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. I got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, “ummm you’re not my girlfriend,” quickly I looked up and realized “oh god I am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. I started to unbuckle and get out. I opened the door and heard a thunk. Now I’m thinking to myself “oh god I just hit the door against the curb but when I looked up it turns out I actually hit my ex with the door.

seesquaredd,awbgpg,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. She is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but I’ve always told myself that I would never eat ass. I just think it’s unsanitary and just gross. But she’s dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but I’ve always deflected it. I decided I might finally give it a try, maybe it won’t be so bad. If it’s something she would really enjoy it, why not? But then a concerning thought entered my head.

I have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend LOVES paydays, the peanut candy bars. There is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. I wasn’t sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. So I decided to ask reddit.

Most of the replies said that it shouldn’t be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let’s go for it.

She gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. It wasn’t quite as bad as I thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. But after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and I could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

I pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her I’d be right back and ran to the bathroom. This obviously made her very self conscience. I was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when I came back I looked like Will Smith from Hitched when he eats the seafood. 

I had to explain to her that I was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. She told me I didn’t ever have to do it again, so I guess there’s a silver lining to the story.

TLDR: I have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

So this fuck up is only like 10 hours old.

This morning, I was at the airport to head back to school. I look ahead in the security like an I see Joel McKinnon Miller AKA Detective Scully from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. My sister takes a picture of us and I’m on my way. While waiting for Coffee I decide to post the picture on the subreddit. I get on my flight and it’s at 100 or so upvotes. I land and I’m at 4K updates and have a whole slew of comments congratulating me for coming out. I go and look back at the title of the post and find out I said “came out to him” instead of “came up to him.” I’m at 25.4k upvotes now and am still getting comments on people congratulating me for coming out...

Okay so this literally just happened. Im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. 

On Snapchat we have a work group chat that I post on pretty frequently. Well tonight my SO asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven't been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. I always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. So apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

I realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. Since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. It wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. Its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


TL;DR Dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


Update: So im not getting fired luckily. Im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. Ive heard so many Michael Jackson just beat it references its unreal. The group chat is mostly comprised of people I go to college with. Even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. My boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  Also holy fuck this blew up! Thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

gwtt2u,9q361o,"This actually did happen within the last 24 hours, I'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

So, weed has been legalized, yay Canada! Obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. My girlfriend and I had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. But we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

I figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? I mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. Fucking harmless. So I spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of MK ULTRA and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. Which were quite good.

We cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. Now, I am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. But, I'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *APPARENTLY* you should start with 10 mg. See how that goes. But on Friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and I didn't feel a damn thing.

We started with two brownies each. Two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. I was fine. So I had another one. An hour later, she could barely walk. I didn't feel it as bad as her. So, I had one more. That's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

Turns out MJ is a helluva drug. Jesus Mother-fucking Christ. We spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. Oh my lawd, I had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. My mind is blown. I could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and I had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

We were wrecked. About halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. We just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. My girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. She wanted to call an ambulance. None of this is hyperbole. We're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. The dry mouth might've been the worst part. It was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

We threw the rest of the brownies out. The smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

TLDR: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. Both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. It waaaaaay too much.

Edit: thanks for the gold! And silver! And platinum! Kinda worth it...?

Edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. I honestly, sincerely hate the waste. But we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. That would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

Edit 3: I *DID* do research, I just didn't do enough. We have now learned correct math from the comments. You're **supposed** to dose edibles using the THC percentage. This stuff has been tested at 18%. So, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and I had 168... Holy fuck.

Edit 4: I used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. Every 10 minutes I topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. There wasn't much smell at all. I can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**Final edit**: Some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. For those making **positive** contributions, thank you! We're enjoying them! 
1. They say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *Wait longer*! Like, a day. It is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. There's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. There's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. I fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. So keep that in mind. ",tifu,Tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload
NotSoSharpShooter,bqtyq2,"This TIFU has been in the making since last September. This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

Late last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

Though I’ve always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

I’m pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn’t. In the meantime a cardiologist said “Tough shit” and bumped up the meds.

During the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.

Flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must’ve been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled “metoprolol doping”, there it was. I still haven’t told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?

My friend and I were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and I was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" So there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. My friend won the contest and we sat down. I started to feel a little uncomfortable. Like someone was squeezing my right nut. It didn't hurt that much when I was sitting down but once I got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. My vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° C sauna). I dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. My friend brought me a glass of water and I chugged it down in one go. I told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. He asked me if I preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, I said I'll have both. I chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually I require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. I laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level I told him that I'm going to head home. I had ridden my moped there so I had to ride it home as well. It was winter and the roads were bumpy. Each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but I managed to get home. Once I got home I walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. Usually I stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why I went to sleep so early. She was worried that I had been drinking or taken drugs so I just told her that I almost fainted and want to sleep now. In the morning when I woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so I rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. She examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. When I got home from school I showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. There they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. We waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that I had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. A nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. I changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. I was put to sleep and when I woke up in the recovery ward I immediately sat up. A nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. They tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. I started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). The nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. They were shocked about my condition and asked me how I was feeling ""as a man"" but I told them that I just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

knightryder_,bk7rz6,"My grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. They don't go out much from their house. So I help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to ATMs etc.  I'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

Few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. It usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. I also had somethings to attend to. So, when I was done, I realised that it was late. I came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that I'll return his pension the next day. 

The next few days were so hectic that I completely forgot about his pension. I usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which I keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. I use the latter one more. After 5 days, I was in need of some cash. So I opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

I was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. I was so ashamed that i ran to their house. I knew that they'd be angry so I bought some groceries as a compensation. As soon as My granddad opened the door,  I started apologizing. He kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as I was done. I handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

Well my guilt was gone and I was again my normal miserable self. I opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. My guilt came running back to me, I walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. I knew I was the cause of this. 

I asked them about it and they told me how they knew I was busy and thought that I'd turn up when I have the time. They didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. I had never been more ashamed in my life.  My one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

They already had a really hard life. They had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. First their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. And I guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. It's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. I guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

TL;DR: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. They didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

anonymouslittlebitch,aeu3kx,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So a little background: My current gf and I have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. Before her I was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. Obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and I'm learning everything for the first time. Long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. I said I was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside I knew that I had no idea what I would be doing and would kind of be winging it. Last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. So we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. She's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
She kind of rambled for a bit, and I was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. The rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than I normally do. This is all new territory for me, but I'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like Christopher Columbus, and she's what I think is India. So I decide to talk dirty. Her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, I figure this is the perfect time to strike. And that's when I cleverly decided to ask if I make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

Her face fell. It's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. I went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. I've been wondering how I could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. We approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. I don't think I'll be redeeming myself anytime soon.

paulastya,bonrm0,"Here we go. This happened yesterday in university. 

So, I wake up at 7 and I have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

I brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. As I am drying myself I pick up the phone to check time and it’s only 7:20 yet and I have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and I haven’t had a good release since a week. 

I take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching PornHub. I take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. I am all into it and realise I have only 5 more minutes left. I give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

I reach university and the examination hall is already full. Here (India) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your Exam Registration. I take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

The invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. I go to my desk and as I am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. I lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

I try to keep calm and switch it to Silent Mode and tell myself if I act normally I won’t get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

Soon after the Unfair Means Squad (They check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. I keep my head down and act like I have nothing. 

One of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. I start sweating and I almost shit my pants. She tells me to empty my pockets and I take everything out and put it on the desk.

 She stares at me and picks up my phone. 

“You seem like a studious one. Why are you cheating?” She said. 

“I am not. It’s an honest mistake.” 

Then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if I have any PDF or Browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she’ll let me go. 

My heart finally stops powering a jet and I place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

My heart now starts powering a rocket as I recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. The video paused.  There’s nothing on the screen though. No image or thumbnail. 

“Cheating from a video?” She says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

There it is. Dani Daniels and Manuel Ferrara going at it. The sound of Dani Daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

The professor dropped my phone and had a face as if I was masturbating in front of her. 

Now I have failed Computational Mathematics and have to give a written apology to the Dean of Academics and Convenor of Examination. 

Anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. Had to send the link. 


TL;DR : I forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. Accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn’t allowed and thr professor caught me. She checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

Edit : 

1. For the people who think this is fake. It is not.   
                                                         
2.  For people who are saying why was I failed and now need to produce an apology one even though I wasn’t cheating - It is because in India these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. Also, I only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. The porn was Manuel Ferrara and Dani Daniels, they don’t have much together. You will easily get it with one search on PornHub. If I may suggest something much more better, please try Manuel Ferrara and The Goddess Remy LaCroix. The video starts with them talking about cup or something. That also is easily available. 

4. About the girl who asked for the link. 

I was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

The girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. As she came outside she asked me why did I bring a phone to the exam and even if I did, I could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. I said I could have but my I couldn’t think at that time and was afraid. 

After that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. The girl accompanied me to the admin office. I accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

It was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. She asked to show me what was the video while giggling and I thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. She started laughing and told me I am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. Then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. She remembered my name and my Department. Then we parted ways. 

For fuck's sake, she is cute. Stop telling me to pursue her. I have another exam later. Maybe will meet her there. 


The Indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

Edit 2: Man I have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. I have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. 

Thanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. I haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.

Edit 3: Invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. In fact, that is the word for Exam Proctor here in India borrowed down from the time when we had a case of Britishers.

Gunnen-Haney,amcn8x,"So I just started in this company a few weeks back. I'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. Starting this job it was no different.

Now, a few weeks later I'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. Somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. My manager named a few and I said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

Then I jokingly said, 'And nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

My co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. She raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. It was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

I guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.

**TL:DR** Joked about anti-vaxx moms in front of my manager who is pregnant, and apparently supports the anti-vaxx movement. Tension on the workplace ever since have been, so to call, quite high.

prisonMike_wants_out,abug2j,"Backstory- My parents wanted me to learn responsibility with money when I was in middle school so they opened a bank account for me with a debit card. They have complete access to it and can take out or add money if they want to. Multiple times while in high school I had money saved up in my account and they took huge chunks out because they “needed it.” I was paid back in increments when they took large amounts of money out but I still don’t think they have fully paid me back for all the money they took. 

Fast forward to now and I still haven’t learned my lesson of keeping my money in a separate account that they don’t have access to. I have to take our student loans to pay for school (tuition, rent, utilities, food, etc). I had $4000 in student loan money in my account last month and I get a text from my mom saying she transferred all that money to her account so she could pay my rent in advance for the next couple months. I didn’t understand why she did that because I’ve been paying my monthly rent just fine but I said okay and didn’t think twice about it until yesterday. 

My rent is due the first of each month and if my mom would have prepaid my rent, I should not have gotten a notification to pay it. But I did get a notification and I was confused. I logged online to look at my account and it said I needed to make a payment. I thought it was just an error or something so I called the 24 hour hotline and they told me there was no payment ever made. I confronted my mom about this and she said “oh crap I forgot to pay it! Let me go pay it real quick.” I was relieved but only for a little bit. She came back later and told me my dad spent all my loan money on bills and Christmas gifts because he thought it was theirs. She told me she is sorry but they don’t have the money right now to pay me back because they don’t have any extra money leftover after Christmas. So now I have come up with enough money to pay my rent and utility bill and am out $4000. I doubt I will ever see anything close to that $4000 again.

TL;DR - Parents have access to my bank account and mom took out my $4000 in loan money to pay my rent. Dad spent all the money and they can’t pay me back. I’m out $4000.  

Edit - I have since created a new checking account online at a different bank and will be moving what money I have left into the new account and will be adding my direct deposit to the new account. Thank you all for the advice so far and the support!

Edit 2 - I am overwhelmed with the number of people who have PM’d me offering advice, kind words, and even offering me money or starting a gofundme. I’m amazed how much people would do for a complete stranger and can’t express my gratitude enough. However, I was smart enough with my money last semester and have enough saved up to still pay my rent. I never thought I would need a rainy-day fund so soon haha. But I am okay and it would feel wrong to accept any of your money. You all are an example of how much good is in this world.",tifu,TIFU by letting my parents have access to my bank account and student loan money.

Bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. So our sex life has stayed at our normal level. Probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

I've been having horrible nausea and headaches. I already have anxiety so I figured I'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

This morning I woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. I Google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. Symptoms include nausea and headaches. And the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

I've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

You're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. Now that I know this it seems SUPER OBVIOUS. But uh, guess I was too horny to think it through.

ETA: Thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

To answer as many questions as I can and also because I feel mildly defensive: He is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. There is no cure but no timeline either. We probably have a few more years. He is in EXCELLENT care at a renowned university program. We adore his team. I've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. This was not reviewed with us, only side effects. The separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. We didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. But it is mine. So all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. We're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. Or they just forgot. Or they figured we'd read the info. Shit happens.

Her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. They were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and I was involved. We went to the bed and started fucking, but before I went inside her friend, I looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

She said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. After a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min.

DrDeepFingers,9ho3ez,"While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It’s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It’s a remarkable sight. 

For those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify… I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there’s another reason to steer clear.

Anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

A genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

“Well that’s a clever idea!” I thought, relieved that we wouldn’t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

Ah but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&amp;#x200B;

The early effects weren’t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: 

“Hey we need to…. We need to… do something… like… now?” I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

This was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

“Sergeant, I’m… I’m high as shit!” He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

“Someone, relieve him!” (genius)

Several individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

“Who the hell approved this!!?” The First Sergeant yelled

“I believe you did..” The CO responded 

“Well where’s the detail that brought it in?” 

“That would be us First-Sergeant” Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned… I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking “ohjesusohjesusohjesus I’m going to get caught...!” It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

I turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other’s laps, goofing off, and having a ‘deep philosophical conversation’ about a bug’s journey through life.

Inert.

I wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.

I assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

At this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

Although I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.

It was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. Found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
So i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. Thats where the FU happened. Few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). Well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, ""wall"" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)

Reezens,9i2mm4,"Obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

So my gf and I adopted a new kitten a week ago. She's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or I go. She also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

Well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and I had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as I had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. So I went into the bathroom and began to pee. As I was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. I looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. I started screaming ""OH FUCK!"" And managed to pinch off my stream. The kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as I pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. This all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

It took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. I set her in the tub and I had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. I got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. The last few nights I've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. I dont know what shes planning, but I'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

My girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that I pissed on our new kitten..

Ch1ng4ling,b8zr2w,"So today was pretty f*cking eventful. 

First, obligatory backstory: My best friend and I often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it’s a lot of fun when everyone’s enjoying themselves and letting loose. One weekend, my best friend’s older brother came home from Croatia ( First time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. He offers me if I want to come but I want them to have quality bro time so I pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

It just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (We’ll call him L) got into a fight with another group of guys. Although he and his bro didn’t sustain too much damage from the fight (The other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) L and I got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. It would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

We caught up and chilled at a local public playground (Keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. Being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we’d deck the other and how we’d essentially easily F*ck the other up. We began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

It was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

All of a sudden, I say something stupid in a mock Japanese accent (I’m Asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at L, when this child that couldn’t be over 8 jumps in and says “Hiiyaahh”

I couldn’t stop my momentum and proceeded to YEET this kid into the sandpit... 

No amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

I went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. He wasn’t seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

His older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. I apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying I talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

His bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. All in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and I got to kick a child in the face... Win-Win.      (that’s a joke)

TL:DR
Best friend and I were pretend fighting in a public park and when I attempted to do a ridiculous kick I saw on UFC, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. Worth it.

Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, I am not worthy of this. I made this post at 12am last night and when I woke up, I was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

I appreciate you all!

Edit #2: I didn’t make one point clear enough regarding the playground. Besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. L and I made sure that our presence wasn’t making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn’t have even entered the playground area at all.

ArkhamKnight342,bjh0dd,"Alright, so this is an old story, but when I found this sub, I had to share.

When I used to be a Muslim, I had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

I was on holiday the day of the fuckup. I got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the Paris attacks. There were roughly six people in it. Then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. For those who don’t know, the adhaan starts with allahu Akbar. When that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. I had to explain to them that I wasn’t a terrorist. Then everyone just started laughing.

I understand that everyone may think this isn’t a fuckup, but I feel like I shouldn’t have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the Paris attacks.

drmcsinister,7pafrt,"Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""Yes, yes and yes!""  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""Dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""Diarrhea?""  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""Of course not."" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

""Keep it together, man,""  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

""You are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""Are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""Bathroom. Now."" she hisses. ""Get it together.""  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

""What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!"" she demands.

""Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.""

""REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.""

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


EDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.

As for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""Please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",tifu,TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.
gryff42,6r3xyb,"This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=new&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=tifu


This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

throwaway5438957,71kxia,"This happened Sunday night.



My oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



I get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



We discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......



I walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



What i did not know was the entire time i was gone, My wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  She got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  Took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



So no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to Surprise her.  A handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  Pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  The text told my son to stay outside.  I had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



So my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  I told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  The look of confusion on her face was priceless.  It took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  Finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, There was our son in his dress uniform and She was estatic.  The noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  Except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  It goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  Also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess TIFU will have to suffice instead.




TL;DR  Didn't tell Wife that Marine son was coming home, Missed out on Sexy times and the second half of the Packers/Falcons game



edit 1: Goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

Update: Wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  Have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  She is worried that this story will end up in one of her Marine Moms FB groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.

Oldybutanewy,7uhdqo,"I'm in my third year of University taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn't afford to go.

Anyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. When I get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

This goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*Explains above about material*
Prof: ""What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?""
Me: ""No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?""
Prof: ""Pardon? I don't have a textbook for this course.""
Me: ""It literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*Shows syllabus*
Prof: ""Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
Me: ""What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?""
*Prof starts laughing*
Prof: ""Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I've never experienced this before.""
Me: ""Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

I then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn't make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing ""This is a new one for me."" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!

Tldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.

Edit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. Ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto's birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.

2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. I highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. It's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I'm sure it will turn out fine. It'll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.

Thanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

Edit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn't crush it but there is no way I didn't pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""I usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam."" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - CZ

Snedgemaster,7m9ywc,"So my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in Australia 10+ years ago. My parents wanted to go out for a walk but I decided I’d eaten too much cheese and couldn’t be arsed. While they were out the internet went down so I was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when I spotted the didg. I thought to myself in all these years I’ve never actually tried to play it (it’s more of a decoration and I barely take it in when I see it) and maybe it’s time. I pick it up and put it to my lips. I felt like I knew what I was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. I take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. I splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. At first I thought it was saliva and ignored it as I had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. It felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. I glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. The second I clock what’s happened I feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. I have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. I run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. I urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. I don’t think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

TL;DR - thought I could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

ikindafuckedupsorry,8kvias,"**TLDR; Company uses Google accounts that are all connected. I fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the Google account, and ALL associated accounts. Everyone in my company is now blocked by Google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. Google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

Preface, this happened on Friday and is still on-going. I've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so I won't be outed since I guarantee someone will read this eventually. I still do not know if I am the culprit, but I am 90% sure that I am. I feel like this is a fireable offence and I will step up and take it if it comes to that. I'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. We migrated to Gmail and other Google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. It's safe to say that everyone is using Gmail or Google in one way or another. Now, our Gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. Keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

I have a friend who creates Android apps on the side. I do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called Titanium Backup. 

As a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), I buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: ""Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

Recently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

About an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

One of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. 

The afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.

Eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

Anyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?

Yeah...

So it's been two days now and we've been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn't helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. The posts I've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since Google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

So yeah, that's that. I'm 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**EDIT1:** This blew up pretty quickly. Luckily, I have 3 PMs from people close to, or reps who can help me out. If I missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. I am in touch with one of them now and I am getting in touch with IT at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. I will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out. ",tifu,TIFU by getting Google to ban our entire company while on the toilet
zjkelsey,7eueeg,"As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...

Sunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

As I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

I got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.

I woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I'm not a big fan of, and napping.

I woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.

I went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn't let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!"" (Dave Chappelle voice)

The Dr. came flying into the room and said, ""Hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!""

My life stopped. ""A stroke? I'm 29? How could I have had a stroke?"" I couldn't comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

What happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, ""couldn't believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" She told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

As I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

My parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I've had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!

The first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

But wait...there's MORE!!!

6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

I awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV's had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

The surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn't see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

Fast forward, to October 2, 2017.

My vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

I could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don't remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

I was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

I did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...

I was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.

What this means for me now is I'll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I'm a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I'm not happy about it, but I don't let it change my outlook on life.

I refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I'm out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.

I tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I'm begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don't be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health

CheetoKnievel,8lmwjd,"Title says most of it.  I was at a tech conference today.  I like to broadcast random WiFi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the Planet Fitness  I thought it would go over well as a joke.  I mean, who hasn't seen ""FBI Surveillance Van"" as a network?

*Holy fuck.*  **Do not do this!!!**

Cops got called.  I got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  They asked a lot of questions.  They had to make sure I'm not a threat.  I cooperated fully.  I have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  I was told I wasn't being charged.  I was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.

Flash forward two hours and I go to log into my work email on my phone.  Huh.  Password failed.  Huh, again.  Ok, let's not fat finger this and lock the account.  Pull out the laptop, remote into my work PC.  Go to log in.  ""Your account has been disabled. Contact your systems administrator.""

20 minutes later I get the text message.

Kingvim,3iymtr,"This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. If youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

I still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.
My son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

Brosenju,6zpf6k,"This happened only minutes ago.


The graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


At the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


Now, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?


Starting to sound like a mistake yet?


If the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.


My first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.


Back at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.


Now I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


I open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.


Oh golly gee fuck was I wrong.


Now at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


I experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


You see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.


Oh, that's not all rust.


*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


Do you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, ""Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


They're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


At least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. Jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and I already need a stiff drink.

TittyBoobowitz,7zoky1,"I've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and I recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. I should also mention that for almost ten years I've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. It's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. Or so I thought. I had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when I received this email from one that I was particularly excited about:

***I have to say when ""Titty Boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox I got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  Your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***I look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

Ooops. My stomach fell right out of my ass when I read that. And of course the most recent thing I had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. I tried to do damage control, but I did not have high expectations. Today I finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

TL;DR: Somewhere along the line while I was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to Titty Boobowitz in gmail and I never noticed. Then I attempted job hunting. No wonder I got no responses.

EDIT: Just because I didn't make it clear - I emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and I appreciated the heads up.

See, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""Accounts"" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal.

[deleted],8jvujz,"Obligatory ""this concluded today"" - I've been working for Uncle Sam for about 7 years now. I'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.

Silly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

Laughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

Now I'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job."" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

This was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.

Two weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer's office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

I'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, They spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so I thought I'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. Patriotism, y'know sir?""

""Well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - We need these floors clean for [reason] and were looking for a class A go-getter to clean them.

I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was super stoked to finally see them in Edinburgh! Most bands play in Glasgow so I couldnt believe my luck when I saw they were playing in my city!

So we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then I heard some bagpipe music was playing.

I thought hmm interesting...not what I expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in Scotland and the capital city I really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

About an hour in I was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but I was waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to come out so I could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

I turned to the man next to me and asked when the Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

It was at this moment I realised I was not going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

BLizardLeLizard,caqil6,"It all started when I was going on a camping trip to North California with my friends. One important thing to know is that I bring up old jokes and stuff a lot (just like Seinfeld). 

First Impact: We were in the trailer, and my friend (I’ll call him O because he is the owner of the RV we used) asked us all if we liked the RV. I said: “It’s a cool RV. Just needs a bit more salt”

2nd Impact: We stopped at a restaurant to eat. A waiter asked how we rated the food and the sanitation of the restaurant. Well guess what. “It’s all great but needs more salt”.

3rd Impact: We got to redwood and my friends all asked me (the metric nerd) how tall I thought the tree we were looking at was. “It’s about 311 meters tall and needs more salt” (that’s a great punchline)

Then we went upward. The good thing is though, that while my friends eat like monsters, I rarely eat anything, so they have to perfectly time their strikes. We went to a restaurant for breakfast in the first day. I went to the restroom after ordering and paying. When I come back: salted eggs. Now I’m sitting in my corner eating salted ice cream. And there’s salt all over my hands.

I ended up standing like 2-3 people behind what I think was Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Holland, and some bodyguard in the immigration line. I got star struck when I did notice them a few second after I got on the line. I discarded basic social etiquette, and just blurted out “Are you Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal????”, interrupting whatever conversation they had. 

Jake got visibly annoyed and turned his back completely to me. Tom just said yes and stared coldly back. Sam also stared coldly at me. Big oof that I didn’t even name drop him, even though he’s also in Hollywood. And then when I tried to continue with “Do you mind if I take a picture?”, their bodyguard hard stopped me with “it’s a bit too early for this” and motioned for me to fuck off.

I felt like I was really rude and an idiot for the next few days; I still do even now. I know it’s stupid to just interrupt people, no matter who they are, but damn I thought they were overly irritated by it.

I mean, as soon as they stepped out of baggage, there was a crowd of like 200 fan girls who mobbed them afterwards, waiting specifically for them (flight arrived at 4 AM and the rest of the airport was completely empty).

BotanicalAddiction,c8ptqj,"Before we start;

 I am a collegiate simmer and as used to constantly shaving my legs for competition, as well as I have grown to enjoy having smooth legs during the summer. A few years back I was in a hurry and tried using a hair removing cream similar to Nair for men, and since then I have always used it for ease. Also, due to swimming and my height, I am compelled to pop my sternum often, and do this be interlocking my fingers together with my arms outstretched behind me and forcing my shoulders back. I normally pop my sternum which is loud as a pencil snapping and at least one of my shoulders. *This will be important later.*

&amp;#x200B;

Now that it is summer, I have been spending most of my time at work in the mornings and laying out at a pool in the afternoons. I have been noticing that I have been getting a tan line from my speedo, and *I hate tan lines* so I decided that I would start laying out naked **in my own backyard** to get rid of them. So this past weekend during my normal follicle extension session, I decided to go ahead and purge the hair from both my legs and my ass. I did my normal routine making sure to not get any of the remover on my literal assh0le and it went fine. (**PROTIP: NEVER use nair on your gentials.** That's a nightmare for another day.)

I went and laid out without an issue, and am slowly looking less like a vampire.

For those of you that don't know, humans fart about 15 to 20 times a day.[^(1)](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19994654/how-much-farting-is-normal/) Most of us don't notice because it's either very small, or *the hair in between your ass cheeks act as a dampener so they don't slap together making the iconic fwwuuueehhhh noise.* I work in an administrative office with 4 other people. We are all very close and talk throughout most of the work day. Today, 4 days after making my ass smooth as a piece of fresh cut granite, the day started off normal.

&amp;#x200B;

About 30 minutes ago, I needed to pee and decided to run to the restroom down the hall. I stood up and begin walking to the door. Right before I hit the center of the office directly in between all of my coworkers, I decided that it was a prime opportunity to do my daily sternum pop while headed to the hallway.

 I interlocked my outstretched arms behind me like I have done a thousand times before, moved my arms down in a jerking motion, and then it happened. At the same time that my sternum and both shoulders popped, I let out the most aggressive and short fart ever listened to by a human. No precursor, no trail off, just one very stecato, yet fortississimo fart that sounding like a small firework detonating. Because the fart came through two veal cutlets, the only made a single wave which sounded more like a single aggressive clap.

&amp;#x200B;

In a split second I decided to keep walking, entering the hallway, and immediately falling to the ground holding my face and praying that god would just send me an aneurysm to end this suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the water fountain, as and need to pee was hidden by the numbness that shame had brought me, and promptly returned. I never looked at any of them, and went back to my desk to ~~write this on reddit~~ work.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I used shaving foam on my ass to remove all the hair, and while I was at work I tried to pop my sternum releasing the loudest and most aggressive fart that I think I will ever experience in my lifetime. I also want to die now.

Growing up my father was not the most expressive when it comes to visual appearance. He has tattoos but are all hidden and has never done anything with his hair other than the traditional even steven with a taper in the back.

Like father like son, I followed. For 28 years I've had the same haircut. When I would go to a new barber, I would even take pictures of a previous cut so that the new person has a reference.

I got lucky some time ago and landed a position at a university where they are very liberal about appearance. The only hard rules for dress code are no hats, collard shirt or three button henley for men, and no shorts.

I decided I was going to be adventurous and change my hair color but had no idea how to go about it. After looking up tutorials I decided it was best to turn to a professionql salon.

Bear in mind that this was my first time in a salon so I am already pretty uncomfortable and anxious. I sit in my stylist's chair and we go over the process. She applies the product and about 20ish minutes go by and she has me sit in a chair hooked to a sink.

She begins washing my hair and I mean really getting in there. My foot starts going like a mastiff when yiu scratch right before hind the ear. The warm water running through my hair and the stylist massaging my scalp made me realize why my partner loves when I massage  her head.

After about 2 minutes of the stylist finger wrestling my hair, I let out a soft moan that was loud enough to make her stop what she was doing. 

Pause for a second... Here I am, sitting in a sink chair, eyes wide open realizing what I just did trying to play it off but it's too late. She slowly starts up again and asks if I'm ok, I am mortified at this point so why not double down on the embarrassing moment. I tell her jokingly that she's really good and she should charge more...

Not the right thing to say. She replies, ""hmm"". I get up to go back to her hair-doing-chair and I see she is bright red and I'm so ashamed, in my neck cape and newly blonde hair.

I was there for another hour and can count the words she said after the incident on one hand.

Needless to say I found a new stylist after that incident.

tl;dr
Grew up conservative. Landed an adult career where the enployeer is very liberal. I went to have my hair dyed at a salon and while in the washing phase I accidently moaned because the stylist apparently had the magic touch. I  jokingly told her she should charge more since she's so good. Things got even more awkward and we sat in silence for the most part afterwards.",tifu,TIFU by moaning while getting my hair dyed for the first time by a stylist.

We met again for drinks, we went back to her place, and we fucked.  We thought it was weird, and then got over it and fucked again, and I ended up spending the night and we fucked again in the morning.

I blew gloriously and felt the sweet release of said booger dam. It was like buck shot into a tissue.  As soon as i did this i knew something was a miss. 

I got that odd feeling you get with a bloody nose.  Dripping but not quite snot, it was more fluid. I touched my nose with the tissue and realized it was soaked. We're not talking little drips of blood but full on red as can be.  I grab a tissue and move the old one to apply the fresh sponge , immediately it was pouring a rain of blood in my sink.  

As i hold a new tissue i start to realize I can't breath and my throat is getting full .. I spit in the sink and a golf ball sized glob of coagulated spit blood hits the sink like one of those sticky hands you get from the dollar machines.  

I went to the hospital and spent an hour with a close pin device on my nose until a doctor could see me.

JoshYx,caq2gi,"Obligatory this happened like a week ago, and **not to me, but a friend. I'll tell the story from his perspective though.**

I was playing basketball with a couple friends at a fenced court near an elementary school at around 9pm. We put our bags and a spare basketball near the bench at side of the court.

Two young girls (looked like 5 year olds) take the spare basketball and start playing with it. I didn't mind, what's the worst that could happen?

Anyway, these girls were having fun playing around. No problem. About an hour later, I went to collect my basketball, as I planning on leaving somewhat soon. The girls were really hyper and refused to return the ball.

As I was trying to take my ball back, they began trying to pull my pants down, grabbing my ass and laughing their heads off.

I looked around for any adult that could potentially be a parent and saw no one. I managed to get the ball back and ran into the court closing the gate behind me. They chased me and were screaming and laughing. After a minute or two they got bored and went back to playing in the park near by.

I continued to play with my friends for a bit, thinking I wouldn't be bothered by the girls again.

Boy was I wrong. I heard some noise behind me, I looked over and saw one of the girls picking up my backpack. She raised it over her head and SLAMMED it into the ground as hard as her 5 year old body allowed her to. I immediately began running over but didn't get there in time to prevent her from slamming the bag down one more time.

I got there and started yelling at them, they immediately ran away across the park. Time to assess the damage... Both my laptop and phone were smashed up. Screens shattered, and my laptop's body was deformed. The phone was still working, so I put it in my pocket.

In the distance I could see the girls across the field and on some bleachers what looked like their parents (What kind of parent lets their five-year-olds run around a park for an hour, too far away to be able to supervise them???).

I ran up to the parents, explaining the situation to them. They didn't seem to care much. The girls started crying at this point, and the dad pulled the ol' ""now my kid is crying! Look what you've done!"" on me. Then he threatened to call the police on me, for harassment! Thinking the police would be on my side, I said ""you know what, I'll call the cops right now!""

At that point, the father realized he could be in trouble and started walking away. I asked for his name, but he wouldn't give it. Meanwhile, the police answered my call. I asked them what I could do, and they basically just laughed at my story and told me I couldn't do anything. Following them would be harassment, they said.

I filed a police report after that, but again, this was only met with ridicule.

Luckily my phone was fine after I got the screen replaced, but my $2000 laptop is broken beyond repair.

TL;DR: Let 2 girls play with my basketball. They threw a tantrum and smashed my laptop and phone when I tried to take it away from them. Police just laughed at me, $2000 laptop is totalled.

Actually happened a few weeks ago cause of a few extra details that came up.

I work at a local sub shop that serves both hot and cold subs. One day it was just me and two other coworkers, we'll call them R and A.

A noticed that the grill was not reaching the usual temp, causing the food to stick to the grills surface. After a moment of looking around, we found one of the pilot lights on the far end had not ignited. Knowing we had one of those long lighters, both me and R ran to get it while A finished an order.

Once we get back, we began to try to strike the pilot light manually with the lighter. Waving it around and failing multiple times, until R got lucky and got it lit. I call the DM and tell him about the pilot not lighting with the rest and how we lit it.

He proceeded to freak out on me. He explained since we have a gas grill me waving a fire around the pipes that lets the gas out could have ignited and caused an explosion. After I got off the phone with him I told R and A and they both turned white and both agreed we'd never do that again.

It was a week later I learned that there is a button on the side of the grill that helps strike the pilot lights and no one thought it would be smart to tell this to us at any of the manager meetings we have been to.

So some background. My wife and I are expecting our first kid any day now. She’s on the last couple weeks of her pregnancy if all goes well. She’s been home for about a month, not as a result of the pregnancy but because she works for the school system and school is out for the summer. 

Today I had to work from home and while I was home, my wife essentially lounged all day. Watched Netflix and listened to music. I did her her an exercise ball to use to help with the pregnancy. She used it for about 20 min or so(Apparently bouncing on an exercise ball can help in the last week or 2 of a pregnancy). 

Now for the FU. I had to run out to do a few quick things that didn’t take more than an hour total from the time we left home to the time we got back. On our drive home she said “I’m tired.” At first I interpreted it as being drained because she probably didn’t eat enough at lunch and her sugar is low. She said, “I’m not hungry, I’m tired.” Which I responded with, “Why? You didn’t do anything all day. Then again you are pregnant.”

My wife then because sarcastic with me about why she is pregnant and that’s when I realized IFU. All pregnancy I was good. I wasn’t the dumb husband to say something insensitive. Then near the end, I messed up. 

We got home, she got out the car before I did (usually I’m out of the car first), slammed the door, walked inside and is currently taking her nap.

First I'll give you some context to all this

So I got to know her back in like 2012 (when she was still male) through a friend of mine that I only knew online. So we played online almost daily. I visited them the first time in 2015 which started as a joke. Then in December 2016 she suffered from depression and raged through her classroom. After which she went to therapy for half a year (where it was more like prison what I've heard) where she got to be how she is nowadays and since she turned 18 she's also taking hormones.

In the meantime I visited a bunch more which may be still important, who knows..

Now it's roughly the 20th of may. I probably a bit drunk and the situation got somewhat heated. But I frankly can't remember much of it, only that I told her her that for me her laugh didn't seem genuine anymore (but that's something I told her a bunch already over the years prior), but more like it was forced. A bit after that the following slipped my mouth, that she only does all of this because she would seek attention.

Silly me turned to the guy she almost always blocks on WhatsApp for a few months until it's gone and forgotten and asked how long it would usually take to pass. He said she'll be fine and it will get back to normal eventually. So I didn't do anything a normal human being would do like apoligizeing so I let it slip. But it arrose a few times but I dulled it down again which only made me send somewhat uninterested things, like Wana hear me completely drunk, here my town's flooded and so on, just to strike a conversation.

Well today I thought I'd reasonably go through it, clean the mess up I've created starting from my end while sadly not considering her's tho. She fairly quickly wanted to talk this out tho. Now here is me still holding on to my statement ( because I asked a few friends about it and opinions being split half ) and I called her up to talk this afternoon. Everything started ok ish with me completely missing the important part APOLIGIZEING. But onece she took over and started asking instead of me telling and explaining where I basedy thoughts on I just blanked out and said stupid shit like my brain always does when I don't know what to do. Which lead her to leaving the call  and stateing we would be done for good now.

So now here I am, kinda lonely and still trying to figure out a way to get back a good friend I had invested more than 7 years into without even knowing if they would ever even talk back...

I already gave sending a gift to her, but that would only suggest throwing money after her is my last resort...
Another would have been driving 10h (one way) to her and letting her do the talks completely.
Inviting her over is completely out other window because it's a whole day of travel for her and it's me who f'd up.

So what is a good way to get back to someone, from perspective/situation like I am in right now?
 
Also tell me if something is unclear I'll fix it if I got time.

So I do my normal routine everything is fine then during my last set doing dumbbell presses I had some trouble breathing. Instead of being smarter on moving the weight I put the one in my left hand down, then trying to do it with the weight in my right hand on the same side it smashes my thumb.

I posted this to r/AmITheAsshole a few days or so ago and I decided to post it here a few minutes after since asshole or not, I did fuck up.

For little story I have the ability to write with both left and right hand and I also play softball. So when I throw something I'm throwing something. And I was about to go out with some family so I just got another shower and was in a towel.

So not too long ago my mom call me and told me to bring down some keys for the rental car. Now this was a really nice car that her dealership let her use while her car was being fixed since it got into a really bad accident and she wanted to use it for my upcoming graduation, I can't tell you what car it is since I'm not really good with those but it's expensive and the keys are just as.

So since I'm in a towel and she understands I'm in a towel she tells me just to throw the keys down the stairs. We live in an apartment house that looks and is like a house but for 2 and a half families (Basically all three entrances to all three apartments are outside) on the second floor so on the side of the house there's at least 20 or 12 steps and she was telling me to throw the keys down to her since I can't go outside in a towel. There's a roof up above the stairs that's about a few feet above your head going up, it's to protect the stairs from snow and stuff so no one slips and falls. It's been here for years so it's a little... rugged if that's the right word.

Exact words:

Mum: Hurry and throw them so you can get dressed

Me: You want me to throw the keys?

Mum: Yeah, come on

Me being her kid and her being my mom I trust her judgment and did as I was told. I threw the keys. I throw the keys right at her cupped hands.

Like I've been so lazy my room is starting to look like a somewhat organized neckbeard nest.

So not considering how hard I was throwing or the fact that these keys are hecka expensive just an idea of going inside and putting on clothes. I threw her the keys believing I was giving her a light easy catch but in reality was launching a missile.

Because the keys were moving downward it picked up more speed and she had to dodge.

I watched in horror as the key broke in two on the concrete. With a second of hesitation my mom instantly got on me only how I shouldn't have thrown them and how she said to just come downstairs. Basically that thing some or most moms do when they don't want to be wrong.

I was basically frozen in place as she lectured me and continue to tell me that they were $300 and I was an idiot for throwing them down to her so hard.

The good thing is she was able to put the two pieces back together and this story is more of a joke at my intelligence when it comes to throwing things.

TL : DR My dear mother told me to throw her keys down the stairs to a rental car. I did as she said as I was in a towel and couldn't go outside. They break. I'm lectured. She fixes them. I get made fun of every time the story is brought up. Happy ending.",tifu,TIFU By throwing a $300 key to my mom (Reposted with TL:DR)
mjg315,car3fd,"Obligatory disclaimer, this happened seven years ago.

I was in college but home on Christmas vacation. During breaks I was employed by a staffing agency and did various warehouse temp jobs. This time the staffing agency set me up as a forklift operator, despite having no forklift operational skills whatsoever. 

On my first day, I informed my new supervisor about this, then he made me watch a video, take a test, then he showed me how to operate the machinery. At that time, as far as they were concerned, I was ready.

My task consisted of loading excess stock from one warehouse, onto a box truck, and unloading it in a smaller satellite warehouse behind the main one. Simple enough. The first few days go by with no issues. However, it should be noted that the smaller warehouse was older and had many concrete support posts every ~15 square feet, roughly. I was essentially left by myself to do this work, and was the only person in this other small warehouse, which is where the fuck up occured. 

Since I was left to my own devices in the smaller warehouse I was more careless because no one else was over there. I would often drive the forklift at full speed (maybe 10mph), after I would stack the containers, etc,  to retrieve the next load. Pairing my carelessness and speed I slammed into one of the concrete support posts and bent the fuck out of one of the forks. I’m lucky I didn’t injure myself.

After panicking for a few minutes I head back to the main warehouse and tell my supervisor what happened and he takes me to check out the damage. The fork is bent upward, completely fucked. It was at the end of my shift so I was sent home. 

The next day I’m expecting a phone call from the staffing agency notifying me that I’m fired. Since that doesn’t happen, I go into work as usual. I head to the break room to put my food in the fridge and I overhear one worker talking to a group of others, “Did you see the forklift at the other warehouse? Some dumbass bent the fuck out of the fork.” They all started laughing, and I hung my head in shame. 

TL;DR I was working as a temp, had no forklift experience, bent a fork on a forklift.",tifu,TIFU by crashing a forklift
hopeless_and_lost92,care9d,"So I wrote a post in a popular judgment sub. I deleted it so don’t look for it. It was about how I told my cousin height matters in dating. I was asking if the way I treated my cousin made me an asshole, but as usually happens in that sub, it quickly became about something else. And yes, the consensus was I was an asshole.

I’m not proud of it. I wrote that post in an episode of spiraling, and was getting in my own head about things. Ruminating and getting caught in negative thought patterns.  

But anyways that post got picked up by several incel subs. They are parading it around acting like it’s proof of their cause. Now I’m getting spammed by all these incels.

d919kl,car4gx,"I love tacos. By far has to be my favorite food. The versatility of a good taco is amazing. Even during this vegan thing I'm trying, I can still make tacos every day if I choose. 

That being said I decided to pan grill/fry (whatever you wanna call it) my onions, pepper medley and add a cut up habanero to the mix. I didn't think of any consequences to doing this other than getting an awesome tasting taco. Well, I was wrong. Took about 30 seconds into the sear I can smell the onions caramelizing then BAM!. The habaneros release a plume of smoke and essentially tear gas the whole family. I've been through this before so as I'm crying and coughing almost to death I finish grilling my medley and the rest of the family leaves the surrounding area coughing.... Even got to the dog.😕.

B_Skizzle,casoc6,"First, some background: I’ve got a decent-sized playlist of music (about 450 songs, nothing too huge) that I hit shuffle on when I’m driving. It’s like my own personal radio station. I’ve got everything from soft piano medleys to black metal. Some songs are naturally louder than others. This is where the FU comes in.

I was on my way back home from a party last night and it was going to take me at least hour and a half to get home, so I put on the playlist. The first song was one by Led Zeppelin. Okay, cool. That ended and the next one came on, and it was this really calming piano piece by Tchaikovsky, but it’s a pretty quiet one and the sound of the rain was drowning it out. So I turned it up a little and everything's great. I’m calm, I’m focused. Then, the next song came on, with my speakers still almost at full volume, and it was a really energetic, pumped up synthwave song. This song is pretty loud already, and with my speakers up so high, I was unprepared for the sudden explosion of sound, so I jumped, which made me jerk the steering wheel to the right and very nearly hit a woman pushing a stroller along the sidewalk. Thankfully, I stopped a few feet short. I pulled over for a while to calm down, but I kept thinking about how I actually almost just killed someone.

anonymBird,cai1no,"Happened 12hous ago.

Backstory: My parents moved from Turkey to Germany when they were young. So some people say I'm German, some say I'm Turkish (I personally don't care).

Now there is my girlfriends mom, let's call her Eva, a super Christian woman living her whole life in a valley. And I mean like going to church at least once a week and praying before she eats.
You don't see this level of religiousness often here. 
She is also very afraid of looking like a Rassist, which she is absolutely not. But you know, just behaving awkward by trying not to offend me.

My family is like every other German family, they don't even care about culture. But Eva, never met them and seems to assume that we are some cliche Muslim family with woman's wearing Hijab and stuff. Even tho  we have been through some Deep talk about how I don't believe in God and my family is not religious.

Now it's my dad's birthday and my girlfriend (24, let's call her Maria) visits my father's family (my parents are separated) for the first time. And Eva is always so overwhelmingly worried about maria and she keeps texting us both how things are going. 

On our way home I jokingly answer: ""everything is fine, Maria loved our culture and traditions so much she wants to convert to islam.""

She responses with a longer text about how she is not racist and tolerant and stuff but if her daughter converts she couldn't handle it.
I'm like ""oh don't worry, it's nothing about you"".
She: ""but she's my daughter.""
And I: ""yes, you should support her in her choices""

She stopped texting, saying it makes her sick. Now she thinks i hate her.

Tl;Dr: jokingly told my girlfriends insecure christian mom my family made her convert to islam. While in reality they are a bunch of alcoholics partying nude at a beach eating kilos of pork meat, couldn't even make a child believe that God exists.

amintowords,car3f4,"Obligatory mention, this was 2 weeks ago, not today.

We were recently at a bar and my friend noticed his phone wasn't working. When he checked, he found out that someone had stolen his SIM card!

He was tipsy but not drunk and said someone must have taken the phone out of his pocket while he was dancing, stole the SIM card, then either put it back in his pocket or on a table where he might have picked it up later, he couldn't remember.

He asked why would someone steal the SIM card and I talked about identity theft and said I knew someone who had their email account hacked into and they emailed everyone on his contact list saying ""I'm on holiday and someone stole my wallet and passport, can you send me $2000 to buy a plane ticket and I'll pay you back later"". The bank account was a dodgy offshore one and his gran sent the money.

I therefore very forcefully told my friend to let everyone he knew that his SIM card had been stolen and he did!

A few days later I got a message from him saying ""Fun update, sim card wasn't stolen I just opened up the memory card tray instead of the sim card tray haha.

Was quite embarrassed in the phone store when they put in my new sim and I was telling them story and my old one was still there.

So i was doing the deed at my room and i thought i was home alone so im completely naked.Then our maid walks by my room, making eye contact with me.

But now she gives me weird looks and she probably thinks that i was going to  rape her.

Now after a few hours, i'm still thinking about that event,cringing.Then my crush texts me""I've been in love with you for three years will you go out with me?"" and i reply with  ""So what? i don't care and no""(I like her but i don't want to date anyone and she was flirting with others so i didn't think i had a chance)
I instantly regret it but don't apologize cuz i'm a stupid teenager.After a few minutes our mutual friends&amp;her friends text me calling me an asshole,idiot etc.And i don't reply to any of them.

Then i showed my wife the internet history to make it seem like her dad did it.

Her reaction was not what i expected. She started freaking out and hyperventilating, and i was telling her to calm down and drop it. She was freaking out for a couple hours, until i got tired of waiting for her to get over it and i told her i did it.

She started flipping out, saying she already told her mom and that her mom was talking to her dad. I got mad at her and told her she shouldn't have done that and i hung up on her. I went to delete those searches on the browser history and she called me back and told me she told her mom what i did. I got really mad at her saying she had no right to do that and she shouldn't have told. I told her that made me look bad and told her now i have to talk to her parents.

TheOriginalMoopy,c9c1r8,"I didn't do this today. If I did, it wouldn't be so tragic; on the contrary, I would be an insensitive dirtbag. No, I made this decision a year ago, and I am only realizing the consequences of that decision today.

Last year I was mindlessly scrolling through Facebook (my first mistake) when I stumbled upon a post my friend shared. The post was from a page called, ""Daily Updates on Michael Jackson's Health Condition,"" and it simply read, ""He's dead."" I clicked on the page's link to discover that every post on this page said the exact same thing. Every day.

""Haha!"" my dumb ass proclaimed, ""What funny and original content! Surely I will jump on this bandwagon and get lots of internet attention!"" So I did what the title of the post says I did. Every day for the next few months, I would post ""He's fine"" instead of ""He's dead,"" because in fact, Stevie Wonder was fine. And that was the joke. Great job, past me, you comic revolutionary. I gained a couple followers, but the joke was growing stale. Since I wasn't getting that immediate internet attention my brain stem craved, I gave up and abandoned the page entirely.

Fast forward. A few weeks ago, I switched from a flip phone to a smart phone, which meant I was using my laptop less. To ring in this life event, I decided to not download the Facebook app in an effort to abandon the stupid site for good. As it turns out, that was a hard habit to quit cold turkey. A lot of my friends were still trying to reach me over Facebook, telling me things like, ""hey, did you get that meme I sent you?"" and ""Did you get my friend request?"" After a week, it was too much. Tonight I caved and went back on Facebook.I had SEVERAL notifications on that page.

I had received some messages, too. I considered ignoring them, but I thought, ""Hey. This meme might have taken off,"" so I smugly clicked on the page's inbox. The messages read things like ""is his concert cancelled??"" and ""I don't do religion, but I'm praying for him!!"" and most dreadful of all, ""I worked with Stevie. Who is this??"" And these messages didn't seem to have that tinge of irony that I was used to on my satire page. . .which could possibly have meant. . .that they weren't. . .satirical. In a knee-jerk reaction, I hastily googled ""Stevie Wonder."" I found the article:

[""Stevie Wonder in ‘great spirits’ despite ongoing medical issue.""](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2019/7/4/20682633/stevie-wonder-medical-issue-remains-in-great-spirits)

Quickly, my smug expression melted into a blank expression of horror.

I knew I couldn't just meme about it, because the people now beginning to follow the page didn't understand that this was originally a joke. Also, you know, maybe that's a little insensitive. Maybe. So instead, acting quickly and doing the only thing I knew how to do, I posted the above link, apologetically (albeit hastily) explaining the origin of this page, and telling my followers that I honestly couldn't promise that I would update them every single day.

Nonetheless, Facebook is now relying on me to provide reliable updates on Stevie Wonder's completely legitimate health condition. . .which is entirely what I deserve. All I can do now (respectfully at least) is take the page seriously. Wish me luck.

This year was my final school year and I thought I would treat myself with some well deserved holidays after my graduation. I started saving money last summer for my only days of peace. I had the perfect way to celebrate my brand new diploma: 8 days on a 3 masts ship, learning how to sail between Denmark and Sweden. Finally some quiet time away from the craziness of the city, from school and from my job. 

I spent hours planning everything, booking a hotel in Stockholm for 2 days so I could be my best tourist, bought expensive sailing clothes to be all warm and cozy on the boat, etc.
I was overall super happy with everything, looking forward to finishing school and leaving the country.

What I didn't take into account was the pressure I was under during the school year. I had tremendous amounts of work, didn't sleep more than a couple dozen hours a week, had a stressful job on the side and some pretty serious health issues.
Thus comes the fuck up, so simple yet so painful: I booked my plane tickets on the wrong day. Which I just discovered today, upon waiting for my transfer in Amsterdam airport. I'm was supposed to arrive yesterday, the boat is gone and there's nothing I can do about it.

There goes all my money, my holidays and my will to live.

Am currently sitting in the airport trying to catch a flight back to Paris, but everything is super expensive and I want to cry on the floor.

mega_crunch,cat3ly,"So this didn't happen today as much but the realisation definitely did. TL;DR at the bottom

A little bit of background info. I'm an amature taxidermist/person with a general interest in dead things as anatomy is fucking interesting. If we find a roadkill or our dog catches an animal I'll probably put it in the freezer to use.

So a few days ago mum was driving me back from my friends she spotted a dead badger that'd been hit by a car. So I decided that while the badgee was too big to stuff for taxidermy, I could potentially preserve the feet and the skin and then bury it to dig up the skull at a later date.

The thing was, this thing stank.

When I got home and set about to work on it I realised just how bad it was. It was clearly a fresh kill from that day (I won't go into detail just incase anyone is sensitive to that kinda thing) and yet this thing was without a doubt one of the worst things I've ever smelt. I kept on having to stop because the smell was so putrid. 

I ended up not taking off the skin it was so bad, but I still took the feet. And then in what may be considered the beging of the fuck-up was that I decided to remove the head and bury it rather than bother digging a bigger hole. Instead I chucked the carcass into a nettle patch in the corner of my field.

It would have been far better not to do that.

At first it was okay, you couldn't smell a thing. But the past couple of days it's been really warm, and things have started to smell. A lot. Depending on the wind, the smell has travelled over 30m. While it ain't as bad as being close to, it is still absolutely foul.

Worst bit is, is that it isn't going to go away for a while until its decomposed. We've got at least another few weeks of this as I am definitely not going closer to that thing than I absolutely have to.

Well...today someone brought in a wild baby rabbit, said their cat had got to it. It was pretty torn up and an entire patch of fur had been pulled off to be able to see the red layer beneath. We’re not really an exotics clinic, so I wasn’t sure what they did next, I had wandered off to do other things. 

Those other things involved things like, you guessed it, the laundry. I was cleaning out kennels and picking up laundry and I took the laundry bag to the back room to dump it on our baskets (at this point a small dirty laundry hill). A flash of furry thing flops out and bounces off my leg ans lands on the floor beside the baskets, I shout in surprise and jump back. Seconds later it occurs to me, it was the rabbit! It was very much dead. 

I’m bewildered and confused, why did one of the doctors or techs accidentally throw the rabbit in a laundry bin?!?! We have a large plastic bin on the other side of the treatment room that instead of using it for garbage we put dirty laundry in, I thought maybe someone had gotten confused. (It’s an imperfect system, resolved by moving it away from the other trash cans long ago but I still occassionally catch myself accidentally trying to throw trash until I open it and see it’s laundry). I then move the bunny to our bin in the laundry room that is actually designated for trash...as much as I would like to leave it outside but I’m not sure if it’s been put down or died naturally. 

The middle of the day I’m puzzling on whether I should tell someone that the doctor presumably messed up. Should I go to my fellow kennel comrade and laugh about the good? Should i walk up to the doctor and be like “Uh...hey were you the one who disposed of the rabbit corpse? Because I found it...in the laundry”, it was pretty hilarious but also I felt bad for calling someone out on the mess up. I ended up keeping the rabbit predicament to myself for a bit not sure what to do or call someone out on.

strasserella,c8nn43,"Yesterday was my 31st birthday and it began with me wondering if I’m actually happy with the direction my life is going. After some deep introspection I realized that it wasn’t my job or my studies making me feel sad, but it most likely was my, and my live-in girlfriend’s, physical health. With work and studying so much for my professions license exams I haven’t been able to step foot into a gym all year. To combat that I’ve been watching my diet as close as possible and maintaining my weight. My girlfriend on the other hand has consistently gained weight since the start of our relationship. I’m guessing between 20-30 pounds, I’m not sure. She’s very short so the extra weight doesn’t really fit her body right. I’ve noticed that my mood can become affected when her stomach hangs over her belt line or I see that new second roll of back fat starting to form. I know she’s fat, she knows she’s fat. And I would never tell her that. And the truth of the matter is, I’ve lost a lot of the sexual attraction I used to have for her. I can’t seem to find her overweight attractive. 

Well yesterday she sent me a text saying we should get high and have sex. I replied with “hahaha maybe”. Now here is the truth, lately, I haven’t found her very attractive and therefore not much of a desire to have sex. After my text, she replied saying that she’s worried and what’s wrong. I said nothing is wrong. She kept pushing for an answer so after continuing to avoid this conversation over the past 6 months, I figured now is the best time to let her know. 

I wrote her a long text explaining that I still want to be with her, love her, and am emotionally attracted to her, but that I think “we can work on self improvement together”. I said “I want us to be more fit and healthier and work hard together to get to where we were when we first met.” I reassured her I loved her and don’t want to be with anyone else. All she replied with was, “I have nothing to say”.

The rest of my birthday was spent in silent treatment. She only spoke to me if I had a question for her. I woke up this morning to find out she didn’t even sleep in the same bed with me. Never thinking I would end the day with going to sleep alone on my birthday. 

So I guess I fucked up for being pushed to answer what’s wrong, and when I finally do it’s thrown in my face and I’m left feeling band about it and regretting even saying anything. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend sent me a text saying that we should get high and have sex for my birthday. I haven’t been attracted to her lately due to her weight gain and eating habits, so I replied with a “haha, maybe”. This prompted her to ask what’s wrong and after avoiding the truth I finally expressed that I think “we can work on self improvement together”. I reassured her I loved her and don’t want to be with anyone else. The rest of my birthday was spent in a silent treatment from her and having to go to bed alone while she chose to sleep in the other bedroom.

ipostoldmemeslikenew,cati0b,"So I would just like to start out by saying I am a huge over thinker and that’s where the problem really started. 

So me and my gf were having a discussion about someone’s appearance and I asked her if she would still like me if I was really skinny. Right now I’m about 315 pounds. She said yes and what a silly question. Then she asked if I would like her if she was skinny. I said of course. Then she asked if I would still love her if she gained weight. 

For some reason, instead of just saying yes, I decided to think about it and then the over thinking really started. I thought since I paused it would automatically make her think that my answer was no. Then I realized I was taking way too long to answer so I had to say something. 

I said “ well would you still love me if I put on over 200 more pounds”.  I was trying to make it sound honest but at the same time make a point that it would have to be something extreme before I even thought about it. I could tell she was struggling with the answer and she was thinking about it pretty hard but she said “ well i would still love you”.  I could tell there was a but somewhere in the but she never said it.

I thought by turning it around and making her answer that it would give me more time to think and/or make her see where my mind was going.

I hate that I hurt her feelings and I really didn’t mean to. I just kept digging a bigger hole by over thinking the situation. I really love her and it really would take something extreme to ever change that.

Wise_Guy_Plato,catk7y,"Alright I know what you’re thinking:


“What could possible go wrong by giving your boss a newspaper?”



Let me explain first by saying that I’m indirectly involved with what happened but it’s still a TIFU since I gave the damn newspaper to my boss.



This happened 1 month ago and my department in the company is still trying to recover.



Last month, I got hired for one of the largest companies in North America as in intern.  Getting this job was awesome since it provides a nice stepping stone for my future career.


As I was entering the building I picked up the local newspaper that was on display and brought it to my office to read.  After briefly looking at the newspaper, I walked into our kitchen area to throw it out when I saw my boss in there getting his early morning coffee.


I asked if he wanted to read the newspaper, he said “sure” but didn’t read it until our lunch break.  During our lunch break,  5 employees sat around the table:


Me



My Boss who we will refer to as: “Boss”



My female coworker: “Maria”



Coworker #1: “Frank”



Coworker #2: “John”




All of us were minding our own business eating our lunch when my boss finally started reading the newspaper.  As he was skipping through the pages, he stopped upon a page that showed a Formula 1 Advertisement looking to hire models for display.



I don’t know what convinced him to say this but he looked at “Maria” and said “You’d be a fantastic model, you have a better body than those models!”.



My balls dropped, her jaw dropped and I felt that time froze.  We were all shocked as to what we just heard that we didn’t know what to say.  Nevertheless, we all quickly left the kitchen and went to our desks and continued on with the rest of our day.




The next morning, my coworker Maria who’s in the same office as me, immediately got up from her chair as soon as she saw my boss walk into his office.  She went to his office and requested if she can speak to him for a few minutes, he accepted.




Maria basically told my Boss that his comment was unacceptable and that he speaks to her with respect and not objectify her.   From what I heard next door, he said “You’re never gonna succeed if you take things personally”.  She left the room furious after hearing that but still remained professional and didn’t lash out at him.




She told the other 2 coworkers Frank and John about what happened in the meeting between her and the boss.  The word quickly spread like wildfire, and this is where the carnage begins.





Frank has been a loyal employee to the company for over 15 years and loved his job, that started to change when our company hired our new boss a year ago.  Frank started to resent our boss since there wasn’t good communication and management in our department.  Over time, he was getting fed of the mismanagement and started thinking of leaving.  The final straw for him was our bosses comment to Maria.



So after 15 years of service, Frank gave in his 2 weeks notice.




But that’s not all,  John who works directly below Frank has been working with him for over 9 years, decided to put in his 2 weeks notice when he realized that Frank was leaving.




Maria had a 1 year contract which was supposed to be renewed in a few months was canceled by our boss, probably out of spite for her calling him out for his sexist comment.




So in a span of 2 hours on the same day we lost, 3 great employees.  But it gets worse, since the word spread like wildfire, other employees heard it and half of them who are female decided to transfer positions to another department since they don’t want a sexist boss.



Maria sent a formal complaint to our HR department which actually reached an executive so there’s a high chance our boss could get fired for his comment.



So in literally one day we lost 3/4 of our department all because I gave my boss the local newspaper.



There’s talk that more employees wanna leave due to mismanagement so there a high chance that the only people left for now are My boss and I.


Oh, and my internship ends next month.



Tl;dr:  Gave my boss the local newspaper, he said a sexist comment to my coworker which caused 3/4 of my department to resign.",tifu,TIFU by giving my boss the local newspaper
shooception,catlkj,"This is something I remember so vividly from my past since its, well ""burned"" into my brain *ba da chh*

Anyway when I was younger, my brother and I shared a room together which was my parents old room. And on one early boring Summertime day a week before school started I was supposed to be reading a book for a report to do, and well little ol me is rummaging through my parents old desk and I found matches. So i started setting small things on fire and blowing them out asap, mostly this old wicker hamper I'd break sticks off of. But then I noticed my bed (my house at this time is over 100 years old and most of the furniture in this bedroom was original) had a straw-like substance underneath the box spring and I lit that with a match and blew it out. Then my little brother who is two years younger than me asked me to do it again so me being me, I did it again but this time it didnt go out when I tried blowing on it.

I ran to the bathroom to look for a bucket but to my dismay I didn't find one. I ran back to my room and I see the flames reaching the ceiling and see the fire growing. And now me and my little brother start yelling ""FIRE!!!!"" and running, waking up our older siblings (7 yrs older F &amp; 9  yrs older M)  and my whole family is now outside looking at the fire spewing out of my window that I caused all because I didn't want to do a book report.

When I got questioned I just said I burned my hand while lighting a match while hysterically crying because I knew I fucked up my parents finances (we weren't doing too well even though we lived in a moderately nice size house)

7 years later were back in that same house and it all worked out but to this day I still quiver in anxiety thinking about it

timythrees,cay4ts,"I (19F) am a virgin. I have super strict religious parents so I just never really had the chance to have sex. But I want to so bad so I masturbate a lot. A LOT. But I can NEVER orgasm, it drives me insane. It’s never happened once. It’s the worst. I’m always reaaaaallllllllyyyyyyyyy close and then nope! Nothing happens.
Anyway I was masturbating again tonight and I was fantasizing hard. It felt amazing, better than it has ever been before. I was gonna finally have an orgasm. Then, I heard my sisters footsteps. She was walking towards my room (which was NOT locked). It was a now or never moment. If I broke my stride or showed any signs of weakness, the whole feeling would be killed. I had to make a decision: stop masturbating and just never cum or finally experience an orgasm. So I made my choice.

My sister opened the door and we accidently made eye contact as I orgasmed. I squirted so hard.

cookielover45,cawo50,"This is an UPDATE, quite a long one too. Before you see this, PLEASE read what transpired in my original post so you know my idiocy, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/caaoah/tifu_by_making_fun_of_my_best_friend/). So sit back and please do enjoy the read.



To preface my relationship with her again, we both joke and laugh at each other all the time and we are always good sports about it. Our friendship is glued together by our rock hard capacities to take a joke. Here is one thing she very commonly does: when I ramble on like I usually do about the bullshit her and I would talk about, she would, out of the blue, say ""shut up"" with a super casual tone after she got bored of my rambling then she would smirk at me jokingly and I would take it as a joke and smile back shaking my head simultaneously. If she was the one rambling, I would pretend to fall asleep by letting out tumultuous snores and she would respond by hitting me playfully and say ""you're the worst"" and we would smile and laugh back at each other. It was like that since we were five, it was really cute, that's the main reason why we were friends for so long (along with other reasons I addressed in my original post).



When I did what I did to her at the party and when I saw her walk out without firing back at me with a witty remark as she usually does, I knew I crossed the line and that I was fucked. I gave it a couple of days, I knew she didn't want to see my idiotic face for some time. I tried calling her, calling her parents, and even called my parents if they knew where she could've gone. It was earlier today when I finally got a hold of her mother and asked her where she was, she responded, ""she's at her house""; I told her that she wasn't there after I checked her house like a million times. She told me, ""she's home."" I realized she was at her parents' house, the house she grew up in and in the neighborhood that both of us lived in. Before I went to see her at her parent's house, I remembered what you guys told me to do in my original post: send her flowers; but, I ventured a different route and got her something that I know she loves infinitely more than a bouquet of flowers: hazelnut and raspberry flavored French Macarons from her favorite French pastry shop. I also wanted to look nice for her so I threw on some casual but neat attire. After shopping for the perfect recovery gift, I finally made it to their house and sure enough her car was parked outside. I knocked on the door and after around 30-40 seconds, her mother opened the door for me with a slight closed-mouth smile on her face. Her mother's reaction to seeing me was so different than her past reactions; she would always have a GIANT smile on her face knowing that her daughter's best friend came over to spend time with her. She let me in and the first thing I noticed was that the inside of their home smelt incredible, it was around noon time so I figured her mother was cooking some food. I asked her mother where she \[best friend\] was and she signaled me down the hall to her room then I thanked her quietly; I saw that her door was completely shut. Before entering her room, I synthesized a blueprint in my head so that I wouldn't do anything mindlessly moronic again. My strategy was: do not make it awkward, whatever you do, do not make the situation between us awkward, make her as comfortable as possible. 



After like 10 minutes of deep contemplation, I finally make a move; I knocked on her door and called out her name, which is the same name as mine believe it or not. She knew it was me because she asked, ""what do you want?"" with a kinda rude tone (which was COMPLETELY justified, I actually expected her to call me a dickface or something), I responded, ""Can we talk?""; after about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes she let me in. Her eyes were as red as a tomato, it was obvious she was devastated and was crying her eyes out; poor girl. I hate seeing her sad, when I see her sad it makes me sad; on the contrary, when I see her happy it makes me happy. So when I entered her room, I set down the macarons on her nightstand next to her twin-sized bed. She sat down on the bed and I sat with her. The thing I noticed about her was, she was SO CUTE, like, cuter than I've ever seen her, 10/10; she wore a red skirt with white polka dots and a velvet colored sweater over a white shirt, I expected her to not look so good but she was fucking adorable. We sat on the bed for about a minute before I said, ""Alex, I'm really..."" but she promptly interrupted and said ""I'm sorry for walking out on you, I was just emotional that's all and I knew you were only joking""; I was extremely puzzled and I responded, ""Why in the world are you sorry? I was the one who acted like a goddamn fool and humiliated you to oblivion the other day, it was no one's fault but mine."" Her teary eyes looked at mine for a while, then she glanced at the macarons I placed on her table and asked, ""What's this?"", I then replied, ""It's for you."" She looked at the box for a second and found out what flavors they were and she smiled slightly, still with tears in her eyes. For the next half hour, I talked with her as sincerely as possible as she was holding my hand. We talked about what I did and how I went way too far, I apologized intermittently to her. Then, after I couldn't help myself, I asked ""God it smells good in your house, what is your mom cooking?"" She snickered a bit and said, ""It's your favorite"" (which is spaghetti and meatballs). Then I said, ""It's also yours"" (it was our favorite food from our childhood). We both laugh for a while then we talked for a while longer about more cheerful things, like the days our parents would make spaghetti for us when we spent time at each other's houses. It was a heartwarming conversation between the both of us and really lightened the mood; it was very refreshing to see her laugh and smile, nothing makes me happier. After what seemed like making up with each other, she gazed into my eyes and leaned in; she kisses me on the cheek, the same cheek she kissed when we were both eight years old. Then something totally new occurs, a rush of blood advances down to my, well you know..., and I oddly feel very aroused especially after looking at her adorable face and outfit. I also wanted to follow through with the strategy that I prepared before entering her room. So I turn my head 90 degrees to the left and we kiss each other for a good 10-12 seconds, it was our first ever kiss on the lips. I break away to think for a bit, but she instantly grabs my shirt collar and comes back in to make out with me for longer this time; I'm pretty sure she has been waiting a long time to do that to me, it was steamy. Then her mother loudly declared that the spaghetti was finished and Alex invited me to eat with them, so I did.


There has never been a moment with her that I didn't enjoy, just being with her and laughing with her always brightened my day. We are both in (the same) medical school and when we are both stressed, we handle the stress with each other and end up laughing. I looked past the things that kept me from being her SO like our names, age, and mostly our very long mutual friendship. I realized that no one makes me as happy as she does and that I'd rather be her SO than to never see her again, so she's pretty cool in my book.


After I left her house, I received a text message from her which said, ""thanks for the macarons dude"", and I responded with, ""shut up ;)"" jokingly.

bucketbarnes,cavkfx,"This happened in Marketing class. This professor was our old coordinator and I had talked to him a few times prior to me taking this subject, mostly about mandatory internships. I work with a very different thing from my major and wanted to see how I’d be able to take the mandatory internship class without quitting my career in IT, which I intend to keep working in.

This semester I had to course Marketing and he was the assigned professor for the subject. Now, I’m a generally good student. I’m not really interested in most of the subjects I’m required to course, but that’s because I chose the wrong area to major in. I usually do quite well in tests, presentations, etc, but I’m not really good at maintaining focus in class, especially if the teacher isn’t talking about something particularly interesting. My area is kind of like one of those you can go with common sense/a little bit of logic and do well.

So I get to class a little late because I had some things to deal with at work, and sit down to listen to the rest of the class. This professor gesticulates A LOT. But he’s also a bit random in the sense that sometimes he greets some of his favorite students in the middle of class, for example, a person he likes arrives and he’s like “Hi, name, how are you?”. 

So there’s me, not paying a lot of attention and the professor gets in front of me and reaches out with his hand. I DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. I reach out for a handshake! The poor man is greeting me because he remembers me from my student struggles last semester! 

Nope. He makes the most confused face ever and then smiles awkwardly: “uhhh, ok, a handshake...?” :)))
He was explaining something about the subject and was using me (random student) as an example. And I randomly shook the man’s hand!!! I look around and thankfully nobody saw what happened since he spoke lowly. But now unfortunately we are forever connected as handshake buddies and I won’t be able to look at him without imploding in utter embarrassment/nervous laughter.

_Eripor,cazq93,"Obligatory this was not today, but rather over the course of my life until today. This also comprised of several smaller FUs that I’ll number for ease of reading. Also, TL;DR (and brushing advice) at the end.

1. Bad brushing: it’s been going on since as long as I can remember, that essentially I’ve been using loads of water on my brush, in my mouth and on the paste, and intentionally foaming my toothpaste to lather my teeth. Following that, I’ve always rinsed my mouth fully with water until no trace of taste remained. Also, I’ve always only brushed in mornings, never nights, while midnight-snacking daily - bacteria basically had all night, every night, to chip away at my dental health.

All this put together just means my enamel never got the chance to remineralize by utilizing the goodies in the toothpaste itself, resulting in weakening over time.

2. Braces: to make matters worse, I’ve also had braces in my teens, which too I am sure were not too kind to my enamel, as I remember my teeth always feeling rougher in the surface since the braces have been removed. But I still had not gotten them checked or cared for them properly, and *brushed* the issue  off for a good decade.

3. Smoking and charcoal powder: the real fuck up is that over the past months I’d started smoking, and using an abrasive charcoal scrub thing to avoid staining. While staining has been avoided, I believe my enamel has been materially eroded due to aggressive abrasion.

Now, at 20-something I am left with dull, aching and sensitive teeth purely due to my own fault. I knew better, but I just avoided the issue because I never saw it’s urgency. Lesson learned: dental care is a daily battle, people. Now I’ve finally started to actually brush right: twice a day, bit of paste, leaving it in teeth and just spitting out excess - to allow you whatever enamel remains to remineralize and restrengthen. Also, the timing is at least 30 minutes before breakfast/after dinner.

While the change is probably very appreciated by my teeth, some may still have to be replaced (appointment coming up), because the enamel does not recover once fully eroded and the relevant tooth is best replaced to avoid infection.

TL;DR:

due to a combination of poor brushing technique, poor post-braces care and aggressive cleaning to avoid staining from smoking, I’ve fucked up my enamel in my early 20’s and could require tooth replacement.",tifu,TIFU by brushing my teeth wrong my whole life and potentially ruining them permanently.
deterkoselig,caxzwn,"Enjoying my holiday to Spain so far, I was just chilling in bed. It was getting late and an itch arose in my ear.

‘Oooh! These false nails are functional as well as pretty. This will totally reach that itch. 😈’

And there I was, contently scratching away. UNTIL IT BROKE OFF. No big deal, my dad always has this pocket tool with him which has a pair of wee tweezers... Except this holiday. Bollocks. 

So there we were at 1am, with a bit of a tense atmosphere, my dad was trying to fish out this god forsaken false nail with a pair of two SPOONS! 

Inevitably it got pushed deeper into my litte ear canal. I put a pillow on the floor and vigorously whacked my head on it in attempts to let gravity do it’s thing. You’d have thought I was trying to yeet off my head.

No luck. This nail was the ideal size, in that it was just petite enough to slide into my ear, but too big to come out with ease!

We went to see a doctor the next day. Again, I’m on holiday, so I was fretting a bit about articulating my sticky situation to a Spanish doctor with limited English.

After about an hour of completing documents, checking my blood pressure and pulse, it was time.

He got out this intimidating pair of tweezers. a syringe and a dish of water. I was given a towel for the wet antics that would occur. 10 minutes passed of having my ear blasted with cold, unpleasant water. IT WAS NOW THE TWEEZERS TIME TO SHINE! 

Holy shit. The agony - the nail was horizonal and deep in my ear canal. He was pulling and poor wee me burst into tears. This continued for about 6 minutes. I wanted to DIE. 

Finally, with skill and a bit of sympathy from the universe, the nail was FREED. This Spanish doctor, his nurse and my mum were jumping with joy, worshipping this evil nail. Meanwhile, I was sat on the doctors chair sobbing my heart out. 😂

So amazed by this ridiculous situation, the nurse took a picture of the nail. What a story this would tell.

Light shone in and it appeared my ordeal was over. No. To top it all off, I had to have an injection. Bang slap in the arse. 

And that, fellow redditors, is the magical doings of Sods Law - anything that *can* go wrong, *will* go wrong.

TheRealReapz,cayqd9,"So this did actually happen today, I work in manufacturing and we released a new product and immediately went out of stock due to a production issue. This culminated today when we couldn't supply our biggest customer. As soon as I realised the issue at hand I called our head office team and spoke with one of the higher ups, let's call her Sally.

I had spoken to Sally a few times before and she knew who I was, and I felt fairly confident when explaining the issue to her. As I finished I just blurted out ""so yeah, that's the **shit**uation"" with an emphasis on the **shit**. She paused and didn't laugh, which sucked. 

Anyway I tried not to think about it once the phone call was done and I finished my day. Im at home now and I just got an email from my boss asking if I said anything weird to Sally. I'm not sure how to respond just yet so I thought I'd post here.

sinabey,cb13lg,"This is an old fuck up, though as a result of which I'm currently writing this post by feeling my keyboard less than ideally.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a 17 year old cat that was barely surviving in her body and she was too frail to walk around.

At that time I recently acquired a 3D printer for work but didn't exactly know what to do, also I had to practice with Solid Works too, so I decided I could be a nice pet owner and do my first project for my cat.

I designed this walker with four tiny wheels. The idea was that she would rest her body on this shopping-cart-esque thing and use her legs to just move it around.

Anyone who 3D printed will know that, prints come with an extra support scaffolding. This is because the printer prints one slice at a time so things such as a table would need a scaffold for the top surface, as the printer cannot print a slice on thin air.

Anyway, this support material is a pain in the ass for intricate models, and if you have moving parts - like tiny wheels for a cat walking aid - it is especially tedious. You take a hobby knife, like [this](https://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-2-Knife-Safety-Cap/dp/B000V1QV7O/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_469_img_2/135-7080905-7452844?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=9HJ9E1QT73VDH8VQ6G7F) and carefully shave off the support from moving parts to set them free.

While I was doing that, I had this split-second-premonition and thought to myself ""I better be careful or I'll stab myself"" and in the blink of an eye, the knife in my left hand just sliced clean through the entire 3d print, and it just shot right into my right hand middle finger.

I immediately took it out and blood started gushing from the tip of my finger. I kept cleaning it on my way to the hospital but there was this weird blot of blood reappearing on the other end of my finger. Turns out the blade entered from one side, and pierced through to the other side.

Not only that I ruined the print, I ended up severing the nerves at the tip of my finger,  as a result of which I permanently lost the sense of touch around the main entry point of the injury. It took me a while to get used to it, and to this day it is a reminder to me about how fragile this body bag is. One stupid mistake and a part of my sense of touch is gone for about \~50 years, where it matters the most.

Since I'm a visual information hoarder, I of course documented what happened before actually treating myself, which is, in retrospect, a tiny tifu within a tifu. A tifuception, if you will.

Ssolidsnk1986,cb123j,"So unlike most posts this had literally happened to me today. My wife asked me to paint out fence a few weeks back and I hadn't got around to it until today. Thinking I would get the job done nice and quickly I decided to get a paint sprayer to make the  job go quicker. So off I go down to the hardware store and grab a paint sprayer and set a about my task. My wife got the idea after seeing our next door neighbors newly painted fence.

I start on the first section that separates me and my next door neighbor (who I barely speak to) and the paint goes on nice and evenly and before I know it the panel is complete. I soon finish the 5 or so panels that separate our yards when I think to myself I hope it no paint went into the next door garden so I hopped up on my ladder to check.......

To my horror I had sprayed through some of the slats on the fence and the paint had dripped all over my neighbours newly painted fence and plants. I scrambled over to my neighbours house and luckily they were out. I grabbed a chair and hopped over the wall.Asi was hoping the wall the neighbor next to mine came out thinking someone was breaking into their yard and while standing on top of my neighbours fence I had to explain what happened to my other neighbor.

I cleaned most of the fence with white spirits but some Mark's are still there and I managed to clean their plants and scramble back to my house. So now I'm sitting here waiting for my neighbours to come home to explain to them I nearly ruined their fence and plants  and was not trying to break into their house.

bronze08x3,cazwz7,"So this actually happened a couple of days ago over the weekend but I am just getting around to posting it now.

The other day I was enjoying a nice afternoon with my girlfriend walking through the mall. I’m not one to typically hold hands but I was feeling rather affectionate this day so I held her hand as we walked. 

I am currently in search of a nice pair of sandals for a vacation in 2 weeks (any recommendations lmk) and that was the topic of discussion as we perused the mall. 

On a side note, my girlfriend and I do this thing when we’re “disgusted” by each other by making loud gagging noises if one brings up something the other one doesn’t like. Yeah it’s corny, but we get a good laugh out of it. Sometimes I really get into it and do my best fake heave impersonation.

Anyways, we happened to pass a shoe store that had a pair of sandals on display and she pointed them out to me. They weren’t exactly my style so que over-exaggerated gagging noises. 

This act was one of my better performances. I wouldn’t be surprised if passerby’s thought I was truly sick to my stomach. 

Unfortunately, at this very moment we were passing by a male couple holding hands. Well not just passing by, we were on the same path so all four of us had to do the backward side step dance.. as I was fake gagging over a pair of stupid sandals holding my girlfriends hand. 

Side note: I am by no means homophobic, this is not a homophobic post. They looked cute together. I did apologize but my face was beet red and I was too embarrassed to explain the whole situation.

Tanmay2699,cax1pe,"So this happened when I was in Middle School. There was a spot at the corner of our School Ground where the branches of some weird ass tree used to fall. One day, I decided to just casually sit there for lunch as other places were occupied due to the Annual Day (some School festival idk what it's called in your Country.) 

It was a windy day and I was minding my own business when I felt an itch in my eye. I quickly brushed it off and went back for the classes. So when I return, my friend is staring at me like I have murdered 6 children out there. He goes on to say: ""you look like a Terminator."" I will never forget this statement. One of my eyes was blood red. I knew the itch wasn't going away but yeah still. 

I completed my day at School and returned home to the same itch and the same red eye. And soon, it went real bad. When it didn't go away for one whole day, we showed up at a Doctor's and he was quick to diagnose me with eye flu (which I didn't think was the case but he was a Doctor and I was failing in History at the time so I said yeah fuck it you're right.) 

I was wearing those heavy sunglasses right in the beginning of the day looking like a blind bloke. My Medicines failed to work and I wasn't doing any better at the end of the 3 days course. 

We switched the Doctors and this new one looked into my eyes with his machine and goes on like: 

""He has a family of worms in his left eye. They have bred in there."" 

I was a providing a free housing service to a couple. Right in my eye and they were loving it so much there that they fucked and had offsprings. Yeah. Worms were having sex in my eyes. 

Now look. I would have maybe loved to provide them for their needs but: 

1) It was my eye. 
2) I am a Capitalist.

He said my case was extremely rare and he called a Doctor to showcase those warms. As soon as the other Doctor confirmed everything the first Doctor had said, I was taken to a minor operation theater. 

My eye was wide open and some heavy water was sprayed in it with some force as I remember. Jesus. I despised that. 
But the worms didn't just go away. We did destroy their home but I guess they were a joint family? 

So the dude decided the open my eyes and pick them out manually. I have no clear idea of what followed. My one eye was closed and one was so wide open, I could only see a few tools in his hand. To be honest, it didn't pain much. But my eye was finally vacant. Felt a bit sad for the warms but fine. More than me, my then sweetheart was amused by the idea that I served as a bedroom for the worms. She was laughing so hard right at my facing saying all of that while I was staring at her with my 2 absolutely NORMAL eyes (I loved it so much when she laughed so hard though.)

Preface round 2: My family is NOT 420 friendly.

Now for the FU, my family and I are visiting some family in So. Cal. I decided that bringing a less smelly THC cartridge would be fine to use on walks or some shit. Not too conspicuous, right? I needed somewhere to store it. Preferably somewhere airtight and not likely to be found by a someone digging through my stuff for a lost sock or something. My choice of container then became my pill bottle. Yes, the one with Zoloft.

SulfurTungstenSilver,caz9ee,"I didnt go into work today as I have the oncomings of a bad cold or flu. I spent all of last night blowing a non-blowably blocked nose to no avail. Called in sick and so stayed in bed and began watching the latest season of Stranger Things. At mid day I thought it time for food. Being too stoned the past week to have bothered with groceries I had to resort to take away, yet again :D and so i walked to the local fish n chip shop for a feed. 

I arrived home and ate away, eating much more than I needed, deserved or could comfortably fit. Surely enough my cat Cotton, needed ask for his feed too. He had been in bed with me watching TV all day. I hobbled my extended stomach out of the chair and walked Cotton to the laundry room; Cotton's kitchen and dinning. Cotton is on a keto diet as of recently. Not to combat his weight but to stop him feinding biscuits all day. It works well.
So I grab a sachet of wet meat bits and try opening it by ripping the rippy end of the sachet.

I hadnt washed my hands from fish n chips earlier and found this incredibly difficult as my fingers were just sliding around like DMs from your sister's mutual friend. Now worth mentioning I was sufficiently stoned during all this. ""My fingers wont work.... use teeth."" I immediately brought the sachet to my mouth hole - which thanks to my cold, is also my breathing hole - and grabbed it with my teeth. Tore it open and inhaled two, definitely two, pea sized globs of wet cat food. Time slowed and thoughts raced. It was like an orgasm for bad things. I couldnt focus on anything, couldnt form a thought of which to act on. I stood there in place, still, then violently vomited, and sneezed, and buckled at the waist and knees.

3 fish and 1 scoop of chips now graced Cotton's dining table. A scattered, but prominent, topping of viral nose spunk layering that. I crumbled to the floor and emptied whatever remained in me. Before I could even stand my dog Spyro - who has a fetish for watching others eat - has rushed in and is hoovering all the sick that isn't within Cotton's recognized territory. Cotton turned his nose and fled, narrowly escaping the departure of whatever pride I had. I sat covered nose down, finally able to inhale and take in the aromas around me :/ and watched Spyro clean as much as possible before slowly heading for the shower.

robotsthrowawayacc,cb00ji,"I'm from a very typical Chinese family. For my family and probably most other Chinese, our names follow a name structure passed on from hundreds of years ago in our family records written by my ancestors.

Example: Liu Xin Hua

My dad's and grandparents generation didn't speak or read Chinese due to the circumstances in my country (colonial days by the British meant little Chinese education)

So they jumbled up the naming structure as the records were written in old Chinese. 

They skipped two entire generational names, and only realizing after an uncle shared pictures of the family records, and even worst after we had 20 plaques engraved with the generation names made.

madkingmatt1,cauowh,"So, this happened about a week ago and is still happening.

I performed an act in this post https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c7kqjl/tifu_by_performing_the_major_tom_technique_and/  - Basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. This part is called ""Getting in the shuttle."" As you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. This is considered ""Take off."" If performed correctly, you should become VERY lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. This is called ""Being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating - last Tuesday.

 I didn't really perform the act because I wasn't able to finish. As soon as I started the first part of the act my head felt like I got two spikes drilled through my skull. Now I get bad migraines every once in a while but this, this was nothing like that. My entire skull felt like it was crushing itself. I immediately stopped and jumped onto my bed where I reeled in agony for a long 15 min. Now the pain subsided to a minimal level and I took some aspirin. I assumed that it was just because my brain was not getting enough oxygen as detailed in the instructions.

I went to sleep and woke up with a minor headache. Throughout the day I took more aspirin, however as the day progressed my headache got worse. The next day my headache was gone and I was really ready to try it again that night. This time increasing my oxygen intake before starting my performance. I was really going at it because of my failure before. I was beginning the procedure and I was going well for a good 30 seconds when the headache hit me, this time much worse. I fall onto my bed in agony and suffer for 5 minutes before trying to cope with it this time. I slow my breathing down and regulate it, took 4 aspirin, melatonin and tried to go to bed. 20 min passed the headache got better but it was still worse than it was the last 2 days. My phone hurt my brain harder and I ended up falling to sleep an hour after my second attempt.

 The next day was the fourth of July and my entire family was coming over for dinner and fireworks. My dad woke up midday when my relatives were first arriving. I felt fine when I first woke up and jumped out of bed so I could get ready and say high. This was a mistake. As soon as I moved my head I got the headache but at the same intensity as the night before. I quickly laid back down and turned on my fan. My aspirin was upstairs and It hurt so bad I didn't want to have to spend time greeting my relatives and answering their questions. I did, however, close my blinds which helped immensely. I went back to sleep and woke to my dad slamming open the door turning on my light and loudly trying to get me up. I tend to stay up late and sleep in during the summer so he just assumed I was not coming upstairs. I, however, didn't want to and wasn't really fit to wake up and enter the world. I grunted that I had a bad migraine, which I get occasionally, and asked him to leave and that I would be up later. I went back to bed and woke up later that night. My head was killing me but not as bad as in the morning. I got up and I thought I was going to die. My head hurt a 1000x more when I moved it vertically. the pain was still there when I was still or walking but not as bad as lowing it or raising it. I was out of water and needed to eat so I went upstairs and entered the world.

 It was just getting dark, around 8, and people were outside doing sparklers and setting up the fireworks. Luckily no one was inside so I went up the stairs, which hurt like hell, and retrieved a handful of aspirins and a new glass of water. I then went back to my room and watch youtube on my phone. The next day my head still hurt and It got worse through the day. It has been like that since then. I am only able to do shit through the power of aspirin and window blinds.

I don't want to tell my parents because it's embarrassing as shit. Google has said it because of a lack of oxygen but my breathing is normal and it's been almost 5 days. Any advice to help is appreciated.

So, I say louder, that this is what she wants.  She says it isn't.  I said ""but mom, it says it's for jock itch"".

Before I could start rubbing the paint around I realized it wasn’t his back but instead his ass. He immediately just said “Oh hey” and awkwardly laughed.

sharkspin,cazzx9,"So this happened about a month ago. TLDR at the bottom. Me and my dad planned to go to a city about 450 miles from our city for a specific course. So we decided to take the convertible sports car as it was a really nice drive down.

&amp;#x200B;

So we start driving taking turns. After a while he felt a bit sleepy  so he pulled over and we switched seats. Since the start of the journey, the keys didn't really leave my pocket since it has one of those key-less entry and ignition systems. After about 25 miles out from our hotel, I realize that I do not have the keys in my pocket, so I pull over. Both of us are frantically searching for the keys while leaving the ignition on. Cause if the key wasn't in the car, we would be stranded in the middle of nowhere. We also spoke about how the car can keep going without the key since we had tried it before. The keys are only needed to start the car again.

&amp;#x200B;

So after looking for the keys and not finding them, we decided to drive back to the spot where we changed seats and decided to look there. However, we didn't find anything there. So decided that it was best to head to our hotel and park the car in a safe spot. After reaching, the moment of truth, I turned off the ignition..... I tried turning it on again, and it DID WORK! That meant that the key was still in the car! Great news! Then I spent another hour and a half looking for the keys. Trust me, I REALLY LOOKED!!! Didn't find them anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

This hotel we were staying at really didn't have their own parking so we had to park the car on the side of the road close to the hotel. I parked it having the entry door almost touching a wall. Then I locked all the doors and left the drivers window down just enough for me to put my hand inside and unlock the door. And as for the alarm, it would stop as soon as the ignition was on.

&amp;#x200B;

So we were in this situation where we had to leave the car there, unattended, on the road, with the keys inside for 4 DAYS! Just hoping that no one tries to steal it. We used to go and check every morning if the car was still there.

&amp;#x200B;

By this time I think all of you are hoping that the car got stolen for the sake of the length of this post, but it didn't. I got a lock and chain the next day and used it to tie the steering to the brake pedal so that no one can start the car. Still quite risky, considering that the car was really expensive, and potentially even drawing more attention due to the chain and lock.

&amp;#x200B;

The car survived the trip. We drove back home 4 days later. I then looked for the keys even more but still couldn't find them. Went onto some forums and checked where people had lost their keys in similar situations. Turns out that a lot of stuff gets lodged below the seat rails, which is where I found the key!

&amp;#x200B;

It was real hell waking up and not knowing if this car was still there or possibly stolen! FOR FOUR DAYS! And all of it being potentially my fault.

We started warming up and i felt like death and it only got worse. I ran a terrible race but we placed finally.

HTTRWarrior,cazrbv,"So this fuck up happened about 2ish months ago and I felt like telling it. So the past year I've noticed that my ears have been getting clogged up. My hearing was pretty bad and everything felt muffled. After a month of this happening, I finally went to the hospital to get them checked. Now I gotta give extra info, I hate when my ears are weird. The thing I hate about pools is how your ears can get clogged with water, and if one side was less clogged than the other, I would want to tear my hair out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing the doctor told me was that it was a somewhat common thing where water get's stuck in the ears somehow. It was a problem that could be resolved after a couple more weeks but I was really on edge. I asked if there was any real way to relieve the problem and the doctor told me the only other way of fixing it would be very minor surgery. The doc wanted me to get a hearing test since I was really pushing about how I wanted this fixed. During the test they put on headphones and played different pings and bangs while asking you to push a button when you heard something. Me being a dumb shit decided to not press the button since I wanted to get this resolved fast (I still performed and all but the more slight sounds I didn't press the button for). 

&amp;#x200B;

After the test, the doctor decided to perform the very minor surgery. I was fucking as happy as can be until she took out a  gauze soaked in some numbing agent or maybe alcohol, and proceeded to stick that shit all the way in my ear. We talking farther than you can get with your pinky finger. So that shit hurt a lot, but wait! It get's even worse. After 10ish minutes she decided to perform the procedure (honestly the more I think, the less I want to call it a surgery). The ""surgery"" involved cutting the inside of my ear and sucking out the water with a metal tube.

&amp;#x200B;

I gotta say... It fucking hurt like shit. I've had a tube stuck up my dick before and that almost came close to how much pain I went through. At first I endured it but as the seconds kept ticking, and the pain and noise kept getting worse. I was out of it. And that was just the first ear.

Cypherage,cazqsa,"Now I have been a dick pic taker for some time, get the right lighting, get the right angle, make your dick look like it belongs on the catwalk, I was sexting this girl, and of course I trusted her enough not to use snapchat or the likes. So I took the pic, sent it to her, and forgot to delete it from my gallery.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, my older brothers future wife needed help moving a wardrobe, my brother was in work , so  I was asked if I could help to move the thing , easy enough empty it, drag it, job done, now because I hate silence, I told her to hook my phone up to some speakers and play some music.

&amp;#x200B;

Handed my phone to her, forgetting about the previous night ,  now I trust most people not to be nosey and go looking through one's phone , but I guess some people can not help them self's , so she goes on my phone a few moments later, she said ""So this is what you get up to"".

I was thinking wtf is she talking about, I went over to look at whatever she was talking about, and low and behold, it was the dick pic I forgot to delete, so I was like oops, she handed me the phone back, i deleted it then proceeded to move the wardrobe.

TemperVOiD,caxezk,"This happened about 6 hours or so.

Was with my parents for a week and half, flew back to my apartment today and everything is going perfectly fine. I’d even say it was a great day. Almost too good. And I was right.

Get back to my place and start plugging in things I had unplugged before leaving. TV, consoles, all that stuff is unplugged, so I go to pull the TV stand out so I can reach behind it.

Now, I have carpet in my living room so I try to lift the TV stand a little when pulling it so it doesn’t snag the carpet and cause something to tip over, *like my TV for example*.

So as I am trying to lift it up, I smack my god damn elbow into the back of the TV and it tips forward. Time felt like it stopped for a few seconds as I reached out to try and catch it. For the most part, I thought I did. Sat the TV back up and plugged everything in... then I grabbed the remote and prayed the thing was okay.

Spoiler alert: it was fucking not okay, half the screen is cracked/black now. When it fell forward, it hit the corner of my sound bar speaker and did a nice critical hit on the screen. 

So it’s 3am and I’m still questioning how I could have been such a dumbass, AMA.

xXTechNewbieXx,cauv0x,"Today I took a hard look at myself to figure out why I was mentally tired all the time. My daily routine is not even physically demanding but every day I would just feel tired and somewhat depressed. I thought it was because of my recent change of lifestyle. To shed some light about myself, 

I’m in the US Navy. Over 7 years in and recently just left the ship life after 3 years there. Everyday sucked but having friends who go through the same thing made the lifestyle bearable. Going out to eat at a local Japanese restaurant in Sasebo became the norm, and it was difficult when it came time to leave. One day you’re in Japan with your friends and the next day you are 6,000 miles away from them. The taste of freedom is what everyone longs for until you realize that you’re also leaving your friends behind. Now I’m in school for training to prepare for what’s next in my next duty station. One thing I wasn’t used to was the amount of free time I had. Wake up at 0600, class at 0730, leave by 1000, workout and be done for the day by 1300. Sounds like a perfect life on paper but in reality, it’s too much for someone who spent 16 hours everyday stuck in the ship. 

After a month in that “perfect” routine, it led to this point, coming back to the hotel tired and unmotivated. I realized today that I have not been taking time for myself and doing what I love. Before the military I would upload jailbreak/Cydia tutorial videos (back when it was popular) on YouTube. While my videos weren’t as good as the pros, it was what I loved doing. It was my creative escape. I have a good idea of what I’m gonna focus on and I’m hoping that this will take my out of this state of mind. 

TLDR: Moved away from a strict work schedule to a more relaxed schedule. Yet spent majority of the month not spending time for myself in a creative way. Now I’m gonna devote some time to make videos again.",tifu,TIFU by ignoring my creative side for some time.
kreeperskid,cax98l,"So I work part time at best buy doing Asset Protection. Essentially a security guard that can't touch people that shoplift, I call my manager and call the cops. Well, today I brought some Subway, and I went into the break room while someone else watched the cameras for me. I heard over the radio that someone got a pretty nasty cut and it was bleeding everywhere. I had just finished my sub, so I run up to my desk at the very front of the store. They were exaggerating when they said it was ""pretty nasty"". Customer had a \*fairly\* small cut on the tip of his finger. Wouldn't need stitches or anything, but would definitely take a little while to heal fully. So I pull out my IFAK (Individual First Aid Kit) that I bring to work every day, I pull out some stuff to clean it, and clean the cut, then I put a band-aid over it. and got some of my cheap medical tape and taped it so it wouldn't come off.

I then realized I left my Power-aid in the break room, so I walk back there to get it. I get back up to my desk and I notice that the customer's girlfriend, \*removed his band-aid\* and was cleaning it with a wet cloth. I then realized, this b\*\*ch got into my IFAK, and pulled out a sani-cloth to ""Clean his finger better."" Anyone with any medical training knows, \*this is a no-no\*. I mean, it won't kill him, but still. Sani-cloth sterilizes stuff either before you use it, or after you use it. If you use too much on yourself, you can grow cancers. I grab it from her and ask her if she knows what it is. She said she thought it was to clean wounds. I explain that that's not what it's for, and that's why the guy's finger is hurting more. I start putting my IFAK away, and I look up to see her BLOWING on his cut. THAT is a BIG NO-NO. That's how people get infections. I immediately tell her to stop or it'll get infected. She stops, and the guy WIPES his finger on his SHIRT. Seriously? Does he WANT an infection? I told him to go to a doctor and get it cleaned properly, cause I wasn't about to deal with them anymore.

So they come back a couple of hours later and say that his finger was starting to get an infection and that I'd see them in court. Really? You reached into my stuff and pulled something out, and without knowing what it was, you started to ""clean"" the cut more. So I guess I'm not helping anyone medically anymore, and I'm only bringing medical stuff for ME now.

This job is the reason I hate people. Seriously people, PLEASE get some basic first-aid training. It's not hard.

peypey170,caxml3,"So this was two days ago at work, I was already having a stressful day because my left driver side car window fell off the track the previous night and had spent the morning fixing it with my dad. 
Anyway, at work, a carwash, in almost 90 degree weather in thick pants and two shirts on. I’m about to pass out from heat exhaustion when a Mercedes SUV I had just sent into the wash 1 car prior, puts his car in park in the middle of the wash to try and turn his wipers off.  Great thinking I know, after putting his car in neutral to be pushed through the wash, he puts in back in park while other cars are in front and behind him. Really makes me think how many bots are out there?
Because of this genius idea to put his car in park, the Ram trunk behind him, which is at the part of the wash where the long clothes are over your windshield, didn’t see him put his car in park and had no time to react, so he rammed into the back of the Mercedes. The owner of the Ram had just purchased the vehicle that day, and was substantially upset. 
The moment I hear the honking in the tunnel I rush to press the emergency stop and radio my manager to come and help me out. While my manager is dealing with getting both vehicles out of the wash, I have to go tell all the customers waiting to buy a wash that we are going to be a few minutes. 
After all the chaos of the collision is sorted, I went on my break, still pretty stressed out and on the verge on a panic attack I decide to get DQ right across the street. 
While in the DQ parking lot I figured I could take a small cartridge dab to chill out. I ended up taking about 4 hits and was wayyy too gone. Driving back across the street to park at my usual spot across my work, my high turned too sharply and let my back right wheel up on the curb, then panicked and put it in reverse and didn’t straighten the wheel out all the way, so i went further up onto the curb, looking like a complete lunatic at this point. I open my door to look back behind me and about 15 feet away are two innocent child, a young boy and girl staring at my high ass trying to park my car, soon I see their mother a few behind them, and she starts to gives me this DEATH stare, like i just killed their family dog in front of them and ate it’s raw testicles. I stare back for about 5 seconds and realize my music is still playing, White Wine by Lil Peep &amp; Lil Tracy, and while it wasn’t very loud, my sound system is good enough to hear it from a good distance, especially with the car door open. I ended up closing my door, taking a few seconds to breathe, and finally getting my car off the curb and hiding my face until the family left and got out of my car and went back to work. 

TL;DR I had a anxiety attack at work, took some dabs during my break to cool down, came back too high to park my car and drove it up halfway onto the curb, opened my car door, had a death stare with a mother while White Wine by Lil Peep &amp;Tracy played. And went back to work.

So i just asked my grandmother about my cousin who just moved to my school this year and I asked who were here parents were because we weren't that close and she has been a popular figure lately in the school especially in our class(section) since apparently she had a boyfriend there (didn't tell my gm cause i aint no snitch) and i'm curious since my GM actually helped raise said cousin when she was younger and said that shockingly she wasn't blood related and her parents are from a far away region from our's, who sold her (yes sold) for about a moderate amount of money and when they found out the child had grown healthy and beautiful the parents tried taking her back but only to be given more money to shut up.
Now it wasn't all that much of an impact since we're not close and second cousins(adopted i guess) and now for the one that actually shocked me:

Now this reminded of her another situation like that except another cousin i'm actually very close with and spent years of childhood with her because our moms are always together. 
She basically repeated the whole story of my second cousin instead with someone who I thought i knew everything about.
Same stuff but different region and twice as more money.
Now i was dumbfounded and shocked as all hell , because its like that type of situation where you think everything's a lie even though it isn't .
After that i know it isn't that much of a big deal if you aren't blood related but its just shocking especially since they were both supposed to be different people with different names and even different birthdays changed to protect their identity.
Its weird of thinking you know all about someone and then just having that all crushed in an instant by just something simple as talking.

MTM2028,caxhrk,"I wrote this about 24 hours ago, originally as a journal entry. The events occurred earlier that night. I added the tldr to the last paragraph of the journal entry, which neatly sums up the moral of the story. Enjoy.

I had a bit of a stomach bug today and couldn’t keep anything down. So when at 10:15pm I saw, just outside my window, what looked like a really big person in bright blue and white clothing run through my driveway, I thought I was just hallucinating, and maybe conflating reality with the movie I was watching (Action Point, 2018, staring Johnny Knoxville). Thing is, I’ve never hallucinated before and that explanation didn’t sit well with me.  

So, about 12 minutes later, I decided to take out my compost and see if anything weird was going on.  I go out my back door and down the walk towards my driveway. 

First thing out of the ordinary I notice is a car pulled over on the shoulder across the road. I see a bright blue/white LED light shining from the car, and it’s illuminating eight legs standing on my (my aunt’s really) lawn, about 200 feet South of our house.   

My initial rationalization of all this: I think there are 4 large men standing on our yard, having a long distance discussion with a parked cop. I figured that one of the men might be drunk, because the voice I hear is slurring. But I quickly realize that this didn’t match up, because the tail lights didn’t look like a cop car’s, and the slurred voice was coming from the car, not the property. So was this some kind of altercation?  

I started walking towards the scene, ready to jump into my car if need be. The slurred voice continues and at this point I can understand some of the words  “I can’t believe this guy. This guy, I can’t believe it. They’ll kill a guy you know” and then calls out to me “hey are these yours?” I am a little freaked out by the mention of murder and reply “uh, it’s my aunts. Wait. The property or the car?” And he says “The fuckin horses you idiot” he then raises the LED and I see that the eight legs happen to be attached to two huge freaking horses! Horses that, now agitated by the light, start walking, rather quickly, toward me.  

I quickly realize that he’s right, these things definitely could kill me, if they decided to run me over, kick, or bite me. So I jump in my car (sans compost). For a time I can’t hear the slurred voice clearly enough to get any idea what’s going on. Instead these horses and I just exchange very confused looks with eachother, until they decide to give up and start heading north on Rt. 34.   


After I’m sure they’re gone, I get out of my car and yell to the guy, wtf, and he asks if I know who’s horses they are. I didn’t, and I really didn’t feel well enough to deal with it so I asked if he’d call 911. He replied that he already did. Frankly, I was surprised because he sounded drunk to me. Anyway, he asked to turn around in my driveway in order to keep following them. I said sure, so he did.  I just finished the compost and went back in to watch TV again.


Then at 1:15, some state troopers showed up and asked me a bunch of questions about it.  Weird night.  

TL;DR I learned a valuable lesson today, take it from me: with its subpar acting, flat characters, and predictable plot line, Action Point just *isn’t* a movie worth staying up late to watch.",tifu,"TIFU by almost getting jumped by four men, and then by two horses, before getting questioned by police, all while watching Action Point"

We usually get naughty when there's no one home, but this time we just felt like it, but we were cautious anyway. In the meantime, her sister was cleaning up her bedroom, so we didn't worry about getting caught (big mistake)

At that exact moment her sister grabbed a pile of my girlfriend clothes, to return'em to her bedroom, and suddenly she walks in without knocking; I still have a mental image of her face when she saw us, her only response was to freeze and say 'Que puto asco' (something like 'fucking gross' in English) she stared at my girlfriend with a face of disapproval, while I tried to hide my dingdong, she then just walked out the room, and said nothing about it.

matthewgoestoUB,caxdnz,"Kinda journaling but feel free to read/offer tips if you please...

So I matched w my ex on tinder. We dated for like 4-5 months and I really enjoyed her but she seemed to love conflict in many different noxious ways. I broke up w her in search of an amicable split bc besides the fact that she was hot, her personality was at a similar caliber (incredible rarity, despite the relationship-ruining bouts of relentless neuroticism)

Well, we’ve been broken up for two months now and I’ve been exercising my right as a single man to stupid dating apps and happened to match with her on there recently. I was shocked, as my swipe right was initially for shits/giggles and so I decided to wait over a day to message her.

I mustered up the motivation to open conversation and at first, it seemed like her reception was subtly warm but man was I wrong. We switched over from tinder messaging to texting and she quickly wanted answers and it seemed convincing - “why are you talking to me, what are your intentions?” And I’m over here thinking OK, the gears are moving!

Well, no. Few messages later, after I expressed how I remember our times for the great not the horrible, she has the audacity to stomp her foot down and break any chance at a re-connection.

She says “I’m not interested in you, I only did this for the closure”

Looking back at the 30 texts, 20 missed calls over the two day period of post-break up drama that I never returned or responded to; she begged for “closure”

Well, she got what she wanted I guess and I’m stupid for even trying, but of course life continues and we learn.

WildOne456,cawnyx,"So, I work at a fast food restaurant that isn't that good when it comes to service, especially since we have terrible management and we're understaffed. Not to mention that we're now losing more people. Great!

Anyway, here's a little background.

I am a hostess there and I have been working there a little more than a month and a half. I am still learning about my job, since the only job that I had before this one was a Japanese Steakhouse that didn't have a clocking system and all I had to do there was stand behind a hostess stand, greet, turn on stoves, and lead people to their seats with some cleaning if it's not so busy.

Now, for the story:

There was hardly anything going on that day, and I was bored. My newer manager (let's call him Brian) didn't want me to sit unless I was on break. I, being easily anxious toward asking for breaks so soon after being called out on it, decided to try to find something else to do. This was when I saw the spray bottle and remembered that, as the hostess, one of my side jobs was to clean the glass door. I already cleaned the tables and the floor, so it was really my only option besides hiding in the bathroom like I sometimes do. I thought the substance inside the bottle was window cleaner, since I only remembered that it was blue and nothing else. I grabbed the bottle, some disposable towels, and a couple of plastic gloves before going out, being cheered by Brian. I felt very good, seeing that I was getting some praise, and started cleaning. Immediately, I noticed something was up. The bottle barely sprayed anything and, when wiping the windows, it would make some nasty streaks across the glass. Thinking nothing about it, I kept doing this on both sides of two different doors, not caring too much because of how bored I was and I just wanted to get the job done.

Now, the next day rolled by, and the doors STILL looked bad. As a result, a new hostess (I'll call her Lily) and I went back, got the SAME bottle, new towels, and new gloves, and soon got to work. Sure enough, more streaks got on the doors. Frustrated, we got one of those window wiper things that you would see someone use on their windshield on their car and tried that. It was not as bad, but it still left streaks. We eventually got our floor manager (I'll call her McKenzie) and Brian to check it out. Not long after that, they came out with a different bottle. It actually sprayed and it wasn't leaving any streaks.

Turns out, I was using FLOOR DEGREASER on two glass doors! McKenzie and Brian were both laughing at this, and so was I for the next twenty or so minutes as Lily and I cleaned off the degreaser.

This was about a week ago, and I was struggling to find a good story to post here, but I went to work today, saw the slightly smeared glass doors, and quickly remembered the ordeal.

Two of my friends, my brother and I were drinking in our basement room in a rented beach house (lots of older family members on upper floors). While trying to lie down next to my brother in my bed,  I layed on my backpack. We immediately heard the sound of air rushing, like the sound of an axe can or arosol air rushing out of an air mattress (I'm lying on a spring bed).
My drunk mind ponders a moment and I say, ""wait,  what is that""..

After about 6 full seconds of the noise I can taste a spiciness in the air,  and begin to feel my eyes and throat burn.

I immediately realized, and yelled ""BEAR MACE,"" and ran out of the room. I was no hero here. My brother ran out after me and we both coughed heavily. I suddenly regained my wits and yelled to the two remaining friends to take the backpack outside. One did so and the other quickly opened up the windows.

After that, my parents went home and rest for a bit like usual. Then, my D asked me to get his phone and give it to him. That is when I remembered that I DIDN'T DELETE IT. I tried to ask my dad to borrow his phone for a sec and he says ""You can get it later, I'm just going to send an image to my boss on his email"". I was scared because he was going to look at his gallery, I just said ""F*ck it"" and went to my room waiting for his punishment. Then, he called me. I was nervous so I walked slowly to him. Here's the conversation

D: Hey son! H-

CM: Ok DAD! I AM REALLY SORRY FOR RECORDING MYSELF MASTERBATING PLEASE PUNISH ME NOW!

D: Huh?

CM: I RECORDED MYSELF DOING IT!

eyetwoituptho,caxr9d,"This is a throwaway for an obvious reason. But well, my little sister is very shy. She usually doesn’t open up around the family and we’re pretty much not even really friends. I tend to not know what to say so we kind of just negate each other. Well yesterday my parents told me they were going out and my mom told me shit as if I was going to be home alone. My older sister was already out; so I just assumed for some reason my super shy sister was gone with my parents.

And so 10 or 15 minutes later, I have to pee and I assumed I was home alone so I just went right into the bathroom with out knocking. Then I freeze with my eyes wide open and unable to speak. My little sister is standing there looking back with her ass to me. But that’s not it... she has anal beads in her ass. And honestly I’m ashamed of myself because in my head I was thinking, how on earth did I not notice she was this thick. This curvy, this attractive, all the terrible virgin thoughts because the blood had rushed to my penis.

This was all in like a split 6 seconds though because she looked like she started to try to yank the beads out; but stopped mid-way and just said in the most embarrassing voice, I’m in here. I said my bad and quickly dipped out. But it was too late, my brain had gifted my penis blood and dick said, get yo’ ass back in that motherfucking bathroom. And I did a 180 and peaked back in saying, do you need any help with that? I’m pretty sure I just interrupted her and she was horny and not really thinking straight either but she stuttered fine. Then she basically turned around and spread her tunnel for me and I assumed she just wanted me to pull it out but I asked if she was wanting me to put it in.

At this point she looks at me and just tells me to hurry so I lift the beads then I put my sausage into her microwave. Now I know this is gross and I am sorry for telling you about this. But I am a 24 year old virgin and I could not help myself. I couldn’t tell if I was good or not considering she was heavy breathing more than moaning but I was going to town on her.

We were so into it though that we didn’t here our sister’s coming back home. And soon she walks into the bathroom because I managed to forget to lock the door and she asks what the fuck is going on. Our little sister was pretty shy about it and was kind of quick to try to leave the argument asap. I obviously got verbally destroyed and shunned by my older sister because our sister is just 18. Later, my little sister did ask me if I wanted to watch anime with her but I think my older sister took that as a booty call and now I have to be a distance away.

Now my older sister is having me stay away from my little sister on threat that she will tell out parents. And I’m pretty sure I’m not going to hear the end of this. It also doesn’t help that the little sister seems to want to bond with me. I feel like her shyness is just going to eventually join my older sister’s side and just stay in her room 24/7. And that will be when my older sister can come in for the kill and get rid of me. Hopefully she chills out or it dies down before she makes it something big.

TL;DR I assumed my family was all gone and walked in on my sister in the bathroom with anal beads in her ass. We exchanged what the fucks and I left only for my dick to make me go back in and ask her if she needed help taking out those beads. I’m thinking her being already horny had a hand in it, but she said fine, but in a shy way. The way she postures herself made me ask if wanted me to have sex with her and it actually worked in a way. And soon after, our older sister walks in completely disgusted and pissed off. And she cusses us both out but mainly was pissed off at me. Now despite my little sister wanting to be around me, our older sister will not let me on threat that she will tell our parents what happened. She also shunned me and disclaimed me and gives me disgusted upset looks whenever I step in her presence. And the worst part, this is just day 1.",tifu,TIFU by having sex with my sister
BrainDamageWarrior,catx3o,"First and and foremost, this is a warning to everyone out there. Don’t take your health or your brain for granted, and please don’t be an idiot. I took my good life for granted and now I’m having to deal with consequences. 

Here goes nothing. Eight months ago, things were pretty swell. Great student at a really esteemed university. Not a bad looking dude by any means. Good girlfriend. Active social life. Really just loving life and college. 

Over Thanksgiving break I make a trip to visit some family and end up a party with my cousin and his friends. There’s a tank of nitrous oxide there, and soon I’m bought in ripping balloons with everyone else. Yours truly has done a balloon once before and was cautiously optimistic. As the night goes on I get more and more comfortable with these balloons. At about 1:30 the tank runs out and sad, no more nitrous. Im totally fucking hooked by now, pretty drunk and with zero self awareness of the risk I’m putting myself in by abusing this drug. But to my enjoyment at the time, another tank comes out at 2, and I’m back at it. Some other memories from the night involve dancing with glows strips that people use at music festivals and going outside to smoke cigarettes. My access to the second tank is less restricted (less people were there so the line was shorter lmao) and I rip several balloons in a short time around 4 am. As we are leaving I attempt to rip the entire last balloon after what I now know is not enough time between binges and bam my head basically explodes from oxygen deprivation. My ears ring so loud, my left eye feels like its exploding, and I instantly have the worst headache of my entire life. This headache still hasn’t gone away to this day. There was a destruction of brain cells in that moment that feels like a hole was ripped in my cerebral cortex along left side and top.My vision is fucked up in my left eye, my head hurts (albeit much less than in beginning), and i feel a shitload of pressure in my ears always. My brain is damaged and it fucking hurts. It certainly has gotten better, but I know my anoxic brain damage will be a part of me always.

Don’t be dumb with drugs kids, especially nitrous fucking oxide. This brain damage is easily the biggest hurdle I’ve had to face in my life and it isn’t fun at all. I didn’t lose all my intellectual ability that day- my memory and basic functioning are fine and I know I’m still at least somewhat book smart- but my ability to function as a normal human being is completely lost, My brain just feels damaged now. I used to not be able to sleep on the left side of my head, thankfully that has gotten better for the most part. I spend most of my time either obsessing over this or escaping with video girls, girlfriend, or struggling at work. Always been a pretty paranoid person so that doesn’t help. Drinking and smoking weed are painful now. Here’s to hoping time heals all wounds I guess. Im not naive tho, pretty much have to accept and deal with this new life. Doing my best.

italian_stalion17,c8oas4,"I [23M], went through a breakup from a 3 year-long relationship a month ago. And I had invited my friend [26F], who knows I have developed feelings for her recently, for dinner at my place.

We had an amazing time, great dinner, and as I was dropping her home, I hugged her, as always and tried to go for a kiss. She stopped me, and I said, alright, not today? And she said, no, not today, not ever. Do you understand?

I went home after, and dropped a text thanking her for a lovely evening.

She probably wasn’t mad, but she did seem cold. 

I feel rejected, and I don’t know if it’s this or my breakup. And I honestly don’t feel good at all because we are meeting in a group again very soon and I’m scared I’ll text her again, or do something stupid.

depressedauto,c6s82t,"This actually happened yesterday.

I was going around doing some last minute cleaning before my husband came home. I noticed the trash smelled awful and decided the quickest way to fix it was to spray a bit of air freshener he bought into the bag. And then had to calm down the baby for a bit (he gets super cranky but energetic when tired). Shortly after, my husband comes home and gets upset about me spraying the air freshener and saying that I must hate him or want him angry by spraying it... Saying that I should have took the trash out and cleaned the trash can instead... Even though he is the one that insists I should **not** take the trash out because last time I did my back cramped up real bad and I'm 26 weeks pregnant. He does easily get headaches from strong scents, but this was one he picked out, and usually he buys stuff that won't give him a bad headache.. And I thought it would be better to smell oranges rather than whatever was stinking up the trash.

So I go ahead and take out the trash, clean the trash can, and start picking up the ""tons of trash"" (like 5 wrapers and a few tissues) that was on the floor that he had brought up in his rant about how I'm a horrible wife... All the while him complaining about me doing so despite having demanded I do it right then... And calling me stuff like ""selfish whore"" and ""pig"".

And then today he called me on his way to work and said quite a bit of horrible stuff... One of which being ""it's your fault I'll never see (stepsons name) again."" And hanging up. Step son was sent to live with his mom after he started being very mean to our then 4 mo baby (hitting him and doing something to make him cry awake from every nap)... Which while I guess it is my fault he was sent away, it's not my fault that she won't let him visit. But him saying this still hurt, especially after all the other stuff he said (calling me a whore and accusing me of having a boyfriend because... I didn't take the trash out?)

This is the first ""argument"" we've had in a while and I spent most of it grey rocking him and trying not to cry as he spews out the most hurtful insults he can muster.

TL;DR I sprayed air freshener in the trash can and accidently triggered a day long, one sided ""argument"" with my husband.",tifu,TIFU by spraying air freshener into the trash can.
[deleted],c4twsv,"(UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)

This happened yesterday. I can't wait until it's much further away than that.

So this is a throwaway, I have \*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.

So I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

She is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office ""XXX,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.

Most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

So along comes yesterday, the big day. I'm so worked up. She's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I'm in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I'm beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office ""XXX"" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can't be, I think.

So I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I'd stop by!"" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""OMG COUSIN!"" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

I race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don't think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don't know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We're supposed to get a drink tonight. I'm petrified and don't know how in god's name I will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  It's hard to reply to all of the comments, so I'll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it's a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.

Yes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i’m going to be honest.  I don’t know.

edit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can’t really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)

• She doesn’t have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• She lives in NYC, it’s big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn’t occur to me, I guess I was worked up.

• I come here often, it’s not that I didn’t call her, but sometimes when i’m here she’ll dm or comment on my insta story and say “hey come by and visit next time”

• In our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  There was no door man or anyone else I needed to get past.  I don’t know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• We didn’t actually say “hey cousin” lol, i’m just censoring our names for the post.

• Yes guys post nudes to reddit, I would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• I’m 35, she’s 26.

• I deleted my account after freaking out, but I’m sure I’ll post again and I’ll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

I decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn’t fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn’t buy the “i just popped in”.  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn’t, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it’s a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we’ll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.

ColdRiks,bzpupk,"TIFU last fall freshers week in my Uni in London. But my flatmate friend just brought it up again. 

I tagged a long with my new flatmate to one of her friend's flats just to drink and hang, it was about 3 days into freshers week and I had a crush on one of her other friends who was also there. Just a note I'm a straight guy, this will be relevant.

I sat down and we all (about 12 of us) just started drinking and chatting in the kitchen. After a few minutes I texted the girl and asked her out, she smiled and me and said yes, it felt like it was going really well.

About 15 minutes or so later they started playing never have I ever and I was like sure, new to Uni might as well pick up some new drinking games, as Im an international student I wasn't that familiar with British/American drinking games.

So a few basic questions in having not drank people were looking weirdly at me and I at them since most of them were drinking like, having sex etc... All of us around 18-21.

Then the next person says ""Never have I ever sucked dick"" and I drink w one other guy and 3 girls. Most of them don't really know me other than from tonight so they are like ""really?"". My flatmate and her friend start laughing and at this point I'm very confused... See I thought if you hadn't done it you drink, as in to make the more lame people more drunk so as to encourage them. But as you'd know I had it wrong.

My flatmate continued to make fun of me for the next two weeks when on a nigth out. And the crush that I asked out, her friend texted me the next morning that she wasn't looking for anything serious rigth now...

TL;DR I misunderstood the rules of ""Never have I Ever"" and my new crush and others thought I was gay and my crush reconsidered going out with me.

Citizeneraysed,cb18t8,"Disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. I only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, “What was your most embarrassing moment?”

So I was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing I would get fully sloshed at the party. She was right.

On the way home, I ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. She pulls her light blue Jeep into the parking lot, I stumble out of the Jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

I (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue Jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. “I can’t wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.”

I was not expecting to get hit in the face. I also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming I’ve ever heard in my life. Instinctively, I covered up my face and wondered what the hell I said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

The screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so I couldn’t really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when I heard, clear as a bell, “You fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.”

WHOA WHOA WHOA instant sobriety. I uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although I was in a blue Jeep, it was not my gfs blue Jeep. My gfs identical blue Jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman’s blue Jeep. 

I finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. She convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

I did not fuck anyone that night.

Adce1234,cb1j5x,"To preface, I used to masturbate a lot, and still sometimes do. Usually, I do it in the shower. For around an hour (whenever I get the chance).

So a few months ago I had the great idea based on the notion of ""since shampoo feels soft in my hands/hair, maybe it would feel good on my dick?"" So I took a whole bunch in my hand, and rubbed it all over. It felt good at first too, basically what you would imagine it to feel like.

Then I got the great idea of sticking it in the shampoo bottle.

With some effort (not to flex but my dick is pretty wide) I managed to get it in there completely. This was not a good idea. First of all, I couldn't even move it around cuz it was super tight. Like there was so much friction, it was stuck. And I couldn't move it out either. I started to panic. I looked like a complete idiot, my entire penis encased by this huge bottle. I tried jumping up and down, pulling it off with my hands, then my feet, it was such an ordeal.

The entire time, my dick was floating around in shampoo-y substances, which wasn't a problem at first. Until it started FUCKING BURNING.

HOLY HELL I cannot accurately describe the pain of having a burning schlong. It was this icy-fire feeling, that kept throbbing continuously. I could barely stop myself from screaming. Tears and all, I was a mess.

At this point I would do anything to get it off. So I figured out a plan, dried myself, put on my biggest pair of pants (some flannel) to hide the giant-ass shampoo bottle and a t-shirt so I could get some butter from the fridge. So as I'm making my way to the fridge, MY MOM tells me to come up to her room to ""talk about my academic failure,""

I sat through 20 minutes of her talking shit about me with a freezing-burning penis. After that shit-show, I tried running back to my room. I was sweating, crying, and couldn't hold my own weight. I fell down on my knees and crawled the rest of the way to my room with my melted butter stick.

To shorten a long process, I rubbed some butter over the lid, and after a while, the bottle popped off to reveal my burning-red manhood.

As i'm writing this, my dick still hasn't fully healed, and I think I ripped the skin, which means no more masturbating for a while

Brenkin,cb1nxn,"Obligatory this did not happen today, but when I was quite young, maybe 6-7 years old. 

One summer morning, I was playing with my sister in the garage. The weather was quite hot and humid, so she opted to go inside momentarily to get a drink. 

As a child, I always had a love for comedy, especially pranks. In the split second after my sister left the garage, I decided I would prank her by hiding in one of the tall boxes that were in there. 

When my sister returned from her drink, he was confused, and began calling my name. I giggled to myself, but decided to stay put in my perfect hiding spot. Soon, my sister’s calls for me became more frantic. Before long, my parents went in to the garage to look for me, and also became quite frantic in calling my name. 

This was all comedic gold for me, so I decided to stay put in the box. What I didn’t expect, however, was for my parents to start asking the neighbours to help look for me. 

Suddenly, about five or six families were all shouting my name up and down the street. At this point, I realized my prank had gone too far, but I didn’t want to face the repercussions of my dumb actions, so I decided to stay put in the box. 

The neighbours continued to shout my name, and my parents became increasingly more worried about my whereabouts. 

One of the neighbours daughters went in to the garage to look for me, and that’s when I decided to let her in on my prank. I told her not to tell anyone, but that I was in this box the whole time. Obviously she proceeds to tell everyone, and thankfully the neighbourhood search promptly ends.

My boyfriend invited me to go home with him for spring break. It would be my first time meeting his family. I was super excited and even more nervous. He was a trust fund kid and I literally grew up in trailer parks so I was worried that they wouldn't like me. 

We get to his McMansion and meet the family. Everyone is super nice. His siblings and I hit it off right away and they were all excited to show me the new puppy they had just gotten.

TheDustyLamp123,cb22if,"Obligatory, this happened yesterday and I am still laughing, while being ignored by my dad. 

As you all have probably heard, or at least seen on your Youtube suggestions, there is a parody cover of Travis Scott's ""Sicko Mode"", called ""Dicko Mode""by DJ Splash Drip. I guess this guy is actually pretty talented because this is the best parody cover I have heard of any song, ever. Naturally I downloaded it on Apple Music to fuck with my friends and girlfriend by having it in a playlist with other random music to see if they notice. 

The fuck up comes when I picked up my father to give him a ride to go pick up his vehicle; he had randomly text asking for my help so I obliged as he is my dad and thought nothing more of it. Now my father is one of those manly men that doesn't really care much for the direction the world is going and is constantly annoyed when his phone tells him that he needs to update to the newest iOS. So we were driving along and I am just playing some music as we drive because it is better than listening to him critique my driving. First up was some xxxtentacion, then Drake, then fucking Dicko Mode started playing. I was so out of my own head that I didn't even realize it until the part where it drops and the verse ""slept through the pipe"" then before I realized it dad looks at me and asked what the fuck I am listening too as the verse ""dicks over rice, that's what I like"" is playing. All I could do was laugh. I know my face had to have been red as a lobster, and I had no good explanation, so I just didn't say anything and played it off as if it never happened. Dad doesn't seem to think it is as funny seeing as he isn't replying to my text today.

Desire_234234524,cb23w2," Hey guys, different kinda comment but I need to type this or I'll go insane.   I'm 18  years old and my girlfriend of 3 months (we've been talking for 4 months) never misses her period. (She has only missed it once and it was by a day) Well anyway, she is on now her third day without her period, now this would be a little scary in itself. However, it gets worse.   

Way worse...   

She essentially ran out of pills however was too drunk to remember to remind me and forgot herself and so we had sex without the pill (she took sugar without realizing). We went to the pharmacy and had her take the morning after pill and essentially still no period the next day and the day after. 

So we decide to buy a pregnancy test kit and it came back positive. So tomorrow we are going to the doctors to have another test (urine and blood test) to fully make sure, but it's looking more and more likely that I have impregnated my girlfriend.   Any info or supportive comments would be greatly appreciated, 

I'm reaching out to this video because I have nowhere else to turn too.   I love her and I have already made my decision to be a man and accept whatever result comes our way. I won't abandon her.

This night in particular I was feeling frisky and was in some chat rooms with other anonymous people and starting flirting with this girl. We start private chatting and she sends me some suggestive but still PG pics of her body and asked if I wanted to buy more. Now I was horny and a little drunk and decided hey let’s blow my money cause fuck it. I send her 20 via PayPal and a few minutes later I get a large amount of pics. Of everything. I was enjoying browsing through these when she finally sends one last pic of her winking to me. This was the only pic she had put her face in and it turned out to be my older sister. I didn’t say anything but I really don’t know how to feel now. 

A few things, 1. No i didn’t send any pics to her, and we never exchanged real names, we both used fake names. 2. No I didn’t recognize her body, i haven’t seen her in years outside of family get together sans I don’t stare at my family’s body’s, that’s just weird.

Emes91,cb29bs,"Obligatory ""this actually happened today"".

So for the time of summer break I live at my girlfriend's place. Because I'm a teacher (to put it simply, without boring details), I have basically a 2-month holiday now so me and my gf (although she does work) kinda turned on the chill-out mode. It has bitten us in the ass today.

So about 3 weeks ago I bought a big, whole yellow watermelon at the request of my gf becaue ""we're gonna make some drinks with it"". Well, the drinks didn't happen and the watermelon remained untouched, sitting in the corner of the kitchen, on top of small kitchen cabinet and surrounded by empty beer bottles which also got storaged there. As it was quiet and behaved properly, we forgot about it.

Yesterday we had a home party with my friend so next morning was very difficult, especially for my girlfriend because she always drinks too much. So she's laying in bed with bad hangover and I make breakfast and stuff because I'm feeling fine - I didn't drink any alcohol the day before.

As I was in the kitchen, I noticed that it's generally in pretty bad shape. There was a subtle, bad smell and I noticed that on top of previously mentioned cabinet there was a small pool of something that looked like water with little specks of mold. Because there is a lot of trash there (empty bottles mostly, as I said earlier), I didn't know where it's coming from so I just cleaned that up and it was fine.

So after some time I mentioned that to my gf and she said ""Oh God, that must be that watermelon, you need to get rid of it"". So because I am a noble, hero boyfriend, I went to the kitchen, took some plastic bag and I intended to simply take the watermelon, put it in the bag and throw it away. I appropached my soon-to-be nemezis and lifted it.

Big mistake.

It turned out that happy microscopic creatures that already established a prosperous civilization inside the watermelon, decided to take the next step in Kardashev scale and made a massive containment breach in form of a hole at the bottom. So as I lifted the watermelon, basically all of its foul, moldy contents spilled out on the cabinet and then on the floor.

As you probably know, watermelon has a LOT of juice. So the kitchen was basically flooded with stinky water and also some yellow, disgusting substance which used to be fruit pulp. I yelled ""oh f\*ck!"" and I kept yelling that on loop for the next hour as I was cleaning this mess up. As soon as my gf realized what was happening, she literally locked herself in the bedroom and started crying and begging me to sort it out as she is pretty sensitive for yucky stuff. Without me, she probably would call the police, ambulance, the army and then she would move out of the apartment.

So I used almost four full rolls of toilet paper and a lot of detergent I was spraying all over the place. I also managed to get rid of the watermelon by gently sliding it off the cabinet and letting it fall right into the trashbin.  After few hours the kitchen still smells pretty bad and my hands too despite washing them. But the crisis is kinda averted. I think I should get a medal or something from the president for liquidating the effects of ecological disaster.

Also, my gf got stripped of right of telling me that I ""don't do anything in the house"" ever again.

As I went to give him his meds for the day he had hidden under my parents bed. Naturally I tried to get him out from under there. While doing so I found an old box that uses to hold my stuff. I wondered why it was under my parents bed, so without thinking I pulled it out to see what was in it. I found some stuff no child wants to find, my mothers “toys”. I quickly put it back and went back to trying to find my cat. My mom comes in to help me find him and without hesitation says” not to look at the box under there”. I calmly said “ no need to warn me”. She inquired why, told her it used to be my box. We found my cat and gave him his meds. We’ve since not mentioned it and haven’t talked since.

ChuckleVisionBitches,cb2l2h,"First time poster

So I managed to land myself my first job, a part-time, seasonal position at a ""pound"" shop, a while ago. For the time I've been here my colleagues and higher ups have really liked me (their words not mine), and regard me as a good member of the team.

As this job is only a seasonal placement, my contract only lasts around 3 months, after which I either leave the shop, or if given the option, can have my contract renewed - where I essentially become a full-time worker.

As stated before, my peers really like me, and due to this my manager pulled me into her office last week to tell me she had 2 full-time placements available for those who are apart of the seasonal placement, and that she was going to put me down for this position. I was overjoyed with this news, as I'd have a decent job which would allow me to save up for uni. All I had to do was work without issue, and maintain my good image.

This is where I FU. Whilst working at the store I've always given cashback - where you charge a person's card for an amount and then hand them that same amount in cash. When I first started out at the job I was never told that we didn't do cashback (although in hindsight, I was never told they did either), and because I've always had the option of cashback at every shop I've been to (that I can remember), I just assumed this place did too.

I was wrong. At the front of the shop, there is an ATM. I've never noticed it, but it's there, plain as day. I'm honestly bewildered at how I've never seen it before, but there it is.

For the past 3 months I've been giving anywhere between £5 and £10 of cashback to usually a single customer every couple of shifts. But, on this week, this last week before I contract is renewed, I had maybe 10 customers in my 4 shifts ask for cashback. Around half of them asked for the usually amount. For the other half, amounts of £20 up to £40 were asked for. Now, as usual I did what I've always done, and given them cashback - never had an issue or complaint from my peers/boss, so I don't suspect a thing. 

As I go into my second to 'last' shift of my contract, I'm instantly called into my boss' office. She looks, if anything, mortified. She asks me to sit, and starts going through the figures of our till gains/losses. Now usually, the figures show only gain - which was showed by my till figures for the past few months.

For the past week, I had a till LOSS of roughly £125. I quickly understood why my boss was so taken aback. I very very very quickly had to explain about the cashback issue, as the first thought that came to her mind, was that I'd stolen this money from the tills.

After explaining, she spent a good 20 minutes explaining the error I had made, and how this was the biggest 'loss' in the companies history, and how I was utterly stupid. She let me go back to my shift and nothing more was said.

I came in for my 'last' shift today (almost a week after the one before), and around lunch, my boss called me into her office. Foolishly, I thought this would be a follow-up conversation in regards to my error. Instead, she informed me how she's no longer putting me up for the renewed contract, and instead to hand my badge in at the end of the day.

B_Eze,cb2lut,"This happened a few years ago but it still pops into my brain occasionally and it makes me wince out of awkwardness. I was living in St. Louis for the summer while I was establishing my residency to get in-state tuition for school but my family lived in Chicago. One weekend, I was going home to see the folks and stopped in southern Illinois to see go out to eat with some family friends (I called them aunt and uncle)  who had recently moved there.  We were chatting about random stuff, keeping it light, talking about hockey, until we started talking about all our old friends. That's when my Aunt, who is a bit of a gossip, let me know our other good family friend was having multiple affairs, which is why they separated a year or so ago. She really emphasized the ""MULTIPLE"" aspect of this info, so I'm guessing it was pretty rough. We finished dinner and I got back on the road for the rest of my drive. When I got home, I had basically forgotten about it because I didn't really care all too much but when I saw my brother I thought he might find this info interesting. So I started a group message with him and my sister (who wasn't there) to fill them in. I type out my text, putting as much emphasis on the ""multiple"" part as my aunt had, and hit send. When I looked up to see my brother's reaction, he was absolutely stunned. Jaw dropped, shaking his head, looking up at me then back at his phone a few times. I said out loud ""Insane right?"", to which he responded, ""Look who you sent that to.""   Apparently, when I went to type my sister's name I accidentally tapped the contact of our adulterous friends oldest son. I immediately followed it up with an apology text saying it was a horrible rumor I had heard about his Dad, but the damage was done.

james_showme_peach,carh89,"Obligatory long time lurker, first time poster. 

This happened a couple hours ago.

So some background. My wife and I are expecting our first kid any day now. She’s on the last couple weeks of her pregnancy if all goes well. She’s been home for about a month, not as a result of the pregnancy but because she works for the school system and school is out for the summer. 

Today I had to work from home and while I was home, my wife essentially lounged all day. Watched Netflix and listened to music. I did her her an exercise ball to use to help with the pregnancy. She used it for about 20 min or so(Apparently bouncing on an exercise ball can help in the last week or 2 of a pregnancy). 

Now for the FU. I had to run out to do a few quick things that didn’t take more than an hour total from the time we left home to the time we got back. On our drive home she said “I’m tired.” At first I interpreted it as being drained because she probably didn’t eat enough at lunch and her sugar is low. She said, “I’m not hungry, I’m tired.” Which I responded with, “Why? You didn’t do anything all day. Then again you are pregnant.”

My wife then because sarcastic with me about why she is pregnant and that’s when I realized IFU. All pregnancy I was good. I wasn’t the dumb husband to say something insensitive. Then near the end, I messed up. 

We got home, she got out the car before I did (usually I’m out of the car first), slammed the door, walked inside and is currently taking her nap. 

I hope I’m alive when she wakes up.

TL;DR My 9 month pregnant wife was tired because of the pregnancy and I told her she didn’t do anything all day to warrant being tired.

Edit: I’m alive. I apologized to her letting her know that what I said was insensitive. We’re usually a pretty open couple. We talk about our problems and concerns without judgment. So our disagreements rarely (I mean rarely) turn into massive arguments. I cooked her dinner, cleaned the house, lit some candles. We’re good.",tifu,TIFU by telling my wife she didn’t do anything all day so she had no reason to be tired.
tacostand15,cb2sjk,"This event happened three years ago during my junior year of university. 

In university, there was a struggle for me to make money, I was focused on my studies and also playing d3 lacrosse. I had little to no time to have a job. My coach forwards an email to everyone on the team that would be interested in helping this small company video record lacrosse games for some easy cash. I was all in for this job to make some easy cash; however, this event took place the day after my annual lacrosse formal (cocktail).  I knew I was going to be hung over, but this was an easy job to make some money.  

After an incredible night, I was hung over and ready to record some lacrosse games. I was not prepared for this event at all. It was November, so it was very chilly out, and off course, there was a breeze. Once I get to my station, the boss man Zeke showed me how to use the camera and told me after halftime I have to stop recording. He stated that this is an easy job and all you really have to do it just press the record button.  Well, the first goes very smooth, I got used to the camera and was really enjoying it. The second game is where things kinda took a turn. So once I finished recording the first half of the game... ya know so I had to stop recording, but, once the second half started, I forgot to press the record button. I did not realize this until almost the end of the fourth quarter. I recorded about 6, and I forgot to press record after the first half of every game besides the first game. Zeke had no clue what I have done because I was too scared to tell him how much of an idiot I am. These records were vital because they made highlight tapes for the players that played in the tournament. These parents paid hundreds of dollars for content.. well I fucked that up.

The day was almost over, and there was just the championship game left to record, I was set to go, but,  Zeke came up to me and hyped me up telling me how great I was doing and if it would be possible if I could record the championship game and I would get a bonus. Little does he know what I have done. Being such a stand-up guy was like sure ill do it. I knew I had one job and it was to make sure I press the record button.... well that did not happen. THE CHAMPIONSHIP game and I fuck this one up again. 

Couple days go by, I get a text from Zeke questioning me if I forgot to press record on every game I recorded and that he now has to ""refund the parents."" I responded with this, "" I honestly don't know man. I am slightly dyslexic, so I couldn't even tell ya what I had for breakfast in the morning. "" I got no response back.

 At the end of the day, yes I'm so stupid for not being able to press the damn record button.. but ya boy still got paid $125 ( should have been $350).

ReasonsFor2020,cb330z,"Like all TIFUs, this happened a few days ago rather than today. So we were hanging out with a few friends for the 4th of July (won't share my full opinions on this holiday but I can say I'm not the biggest fan of it) the other day. There was 4 of us, and we were at my friend's house, we'll call him Nate. There were also 3 others there, and we were all just hanging out drinking a little and watching some TV.


After a while, they decide to go out on the balcony (he lives on the 4th floor) so they can have a cigarette and Nate wanted to pack a bowl. Well before I joined them outside I ran to the bathroom to pee right quick, and then went straight outside. Here's where things got dicey.


So me and my friends have this running joke where if someone says their struggling with something, we'll but in and say ""Well atleast your not that idiot Trump!"" or something similar. Or if someone is ever talking about a foreign country we'll say ""I'm so jealous that they don't have a clown idiot in charge of their country."" Considering we often joke about how bad the president is, it should be obvious to all of us that none of us would ever support anything that man does.


Well heres where I messed up. As soon as I walked out on the balcony, I noticed something immediately off. One of our friends, we'll call him Ben, was leaning over the balcony smoking a cigarette, and much to my surprise, he had a red trucker hat on. This startled me a bit as I had been drinking a decent amount, and I obviously wasn't in the best headspace. I got up right behind him and brushed my hand up his neck and knocked the hat off and over the balcony and immediately called him out (again, I had been drinking a fair amount, and can get ticked off pretty easily when I've been drinking.


Apparently this startled him a good bit too as he jumped up and jerked his arms as if he wasn't expecting me. Little did I know, he had a his phone on the rail and he actually managed to knock it off when he jerked his arms around. The kicker of this whole thing is that it wasn't even a MAGA hat, so it was pointless for me to even throw it off the balcony. It was a ""Make Orwell Fiction Again"" hat which I quite liked once I realized what it said.


So his phone landed on the grass on the ground and the hat landed in a bush right by the building. The phone doesn't appear to have a broken screen, but it won't power on and doesn't appear to charge (its an iPhone 8 btw). The hat was fine other than just a bit of dirt.


So my friend Ben immediately freaked out on me a bit when I startled him. He seemed more upset about the phone than knocking the hat off, which I would expect as phones are much more expensive than a trucker hat. I apologized to him for what felt like a minute straight (basically the whole time we were going down the stairs to get the stuff). He calmed down once he got his stuff back but was still pretty ticked off about the phone. I don't currently have any money so I can't help him get a new one, although I offered to let him use my old iPhone SE and he declined.


We only all stayed over at Nate's for like another hour. It was quiet and I think they were pretty uncomfortable with the tension between me and Ben. No one talked much and we mostly just kind of sat around on the couches reading our phones, except Ben was watching TV. After a while, Ben just got up and left after no one had said anything for like 20 minutes. He didn't even say goodbye. My buddy, we'll call him Josh, was saying I need to do something for Ben, but I don't know what to do as I don't make any money.


I haven't talked to Ben since then, and he hasn't said a single thing in our group chat. I don't know why he would just go off the radar on us, as we've been close friends for years. I'm thinking I might wait a bit till like tomorrow or Thursday and then text him and apologize again. So at this point, I'm just hoping we didn't jeapordize a friendship all because I mistakenly thought my friend was a POS for 5 seconds.

TL;DR - Hanging out with a few friends for July 4th. Everyone goes out on the balcony to smoke, and I go out after I run to the restroom. I see my friend wearing a red trucker hat and in my drunken stupor thought it was a MAGA hat. Proceeded to knock it off his head over the balcony railing, and he knocked his phone off the railing when I startled him. Now his phone is broke and he hasn't hit me up since that day.",tifu,TIFU by possibly ruining a friendship because I mistakenly thought my friend was wearing a certain hat
